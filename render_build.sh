# Runs on every deploy. Installs Python dependencies, and —
# ONLY when explicitly requested — bootstraps the PostgreSQL
# database (DDL + seed).
#
# RUN_DB_BOOTSTRAP (decided 2026-10-05, corrected 2026-10-05):
# gates ONLY the Phase 13 NSSAdmin seed step (scripts/bootstrap_admin.py),
# not the DDL/seed phases. Everything else (Phase 0-12, 14) always runs,
# idempotently (skip-on-exists) — same as database/scripts/02_build.sh —
# so a routine deploy safely picks up any DDL/seed added since the last
# deploy (e.g. a new table like user_session) without needing to drop
# and recreate anything.
#
# An earlier version of this script wrapped the entire DDL+seed bootstrap
# (every phase) behind this flag with a single `exit 0` gate at the top.
# That was wrong: setting RUN_DB_BOOTSTRAP=false to skip re-seeding the
# admin account also silently skipped all DDL, including newly-added
# tables (e.g. user_session never got created), and because the flag
# defaults to false, every subsequent deploy became a complete no-op
# that still reported a clean build. Fixed by moving the gate down to
# wrap only the Phase 13 call.
#
# Existence-gated bootstrap (Version 3.0, 2026-10-05) —
# "only genuinely new tables are ever created or seeded; a
# table that already exists is never dropped, re-created, or
# re-seeded, so its live data is never touched."
#
# Before this version the build relied on error-string matching
# (catch "already exists" / "duplicate key" and SKIP). That is
# fragile: it depends on the exact wording of Postgres errors and
# cannot distinguish "this seed row already exists" from "this
# seed would have overwritten/changed live data". It replaces it
# with a deterministic catalog check: for every business table we
# ask the Postgres catalog -- to_regclass('nss.<table>') -- whether
# the table exists BEFORE doing anything.
#
#   table EXISTS  -> skip its DDL *and* its seed entirely.
#                    Live data is never read or written.
#   table ABSENT  -> create it (run DDL), then run its seed.
#                    This is the only path that writes seed data.
#
# A redeploy against the current live DB therefore reports
# [EXISTS] skip for every table that is already there, and only
# creates the genuinely new ones (e.g. user_session) — with zero
# risk to existing rows.
#
# Non-table objects (schema, extensions, triggers, functions,
# deferred FK wiring, GRANTs, role creation) stay on run_sql():
# they are independently idempotent (CREATE OR REPLACE, DROP
# TRIGGER IF EXISTS + CREATE, IF NOT EXISTS, additive GRANTs) and
# carry no business data, so re-running them is always safe. The
# Phase 14 audit-trigger DO block in particular re-scans the nss
# schema on every run and (re)attaches the audit trigger to EVERY
# table present — including any table newly created this run.
