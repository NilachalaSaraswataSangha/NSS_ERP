"""
UI tests for the per-organization-tier dashboard (org-dashboard.js).

One Alpine component (`orgDashboardTab()`) renders six layouts — Sakha,
Anchalika, Zilla, Kendra, Patha Chakra, Mahila Sangha — chosen by the viewed
org's `organization_type_code`. It is embedded identically as a nested
`x-data` scope inside both host pages' own tab shell:

  * admin.html    — `<template x-if="activeTab === 'orgDashboard' && viewingOrgPk">`
  * dashboard.html — same tab body, host var is `tab` not `activeTab`

Both hosts wire the same `openOrgDashboard(orgPk)` / `viewingOrgPk` /
`dashboardOrgsFor(typeCode)` / `viewingOrgDashboardLabel` contract so the
nested component's markup and behaviour are identical either side — this is
the coverage-gap audit's "org dashboards + switcher" item.

Verified selectors/wiring (frontend/assets/js/org-dashboard.js,
frontend/admin.html, frontend/dashboard.html):
  * host state    : `viewingOrgPk` (null until set), `openOrgDashboard(orgPk)`
                    nulls it then sets it next tick (forces remount)
  * tier getters  : isSakha / isChildOverviewTier (Anchalika+Zilla) / isKendra
                    / isPathaChakra / isMahila — exactly the six ORGANIZATIONAL
                    role_master rows (SOL-ADMIN-004 §8.7), matched 1:1 against
                    each host's `x-show="is...."` tier blocks
  * entry point   : "View Dashboard" button (admin.html Organizations tab,
                    `@click="openOrgDashboard(org.organization_pk)"`)
  * switcher      : `<select id="orgSwitcherSelect">` in admin.html,
                    `id="orgSwitcherSelectDash"` in dashboard.html (the two
                    ids differ — verified, not a typo), shown only when
                    `dashboardOrgsFor(typeCode).length > 1`; each `<option>`
                    is a same-type org in the admin's scope; `@change` calls
                    `openOrgDashboard($event.target.value)`. admin.html's
                    option label appends " (CODE)"; dashboard.html's does not.
  * Sakha stats   : "Members" / "Families" / "Renewals Due" (badge-muted "Not
                    tracked yet") / "Attendance" (same) stat tiles; Darshak
                    card badge; "Recent Members" table
  * Anchalika/Zilla: "Sakha Sanghas" / "Total Members" / "Families" tiles,
                    Zilla-only "Renewals Due", Anchalika-only "Mahila Sanghas";
                    child-org table rows are `link link-hover` buttons that
                    themselves call `openOrgDashboard(c.organization_pk)`
                    (drill-down)

Two of the six tiers, and the switcher, require an admin whose scope actually
covers more than one org of a type to observe non-trivial states — these
browser tests are precondition-guarded and skip when the fixture DB doesn't
have that shape, per the family-management test's pattern. The tier-routing
and host-parity checks below need no browser at all.

Requires a live server + Postgres for the browser tests
(BASE_URL http://127.0.0.1:8001); the source-parity tests run anywhere.
