Tests run against the same nss.* schema used by the application.

Requirements:
  - Local PostgreSQL running with nss schema bootstrapped
  - api/.env configured with DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST, DB_PORT
  - pytest + httpx installed

Usage:
  pytest                        # run all tests
  pytest -m integration         # run only integration tests
  pytest tests/test_bootstrap.py  # run specific file
