"""
NSS ERP — Shared test fixtures.

Provides a FastAPI TestClient backed by the local PostgreSQL database
with **automatic transaction rollback** — every test module's DB
changes (INSERTs, UPDATEs, sequence increments) are rolled back after
the module finishes. No manual cleanup needed.

Architecture:
  - A session-scoped write connection opens a long-lived transaction.
  - Each test module opens a SAVEPOINT at the start and rolls back
    to it at the end, undoing all changes made by that module.
  - Both `get_connection` and `get_write_connection` FastAPI
    dependencies are overridden to yield the same test connection,
    so API endpoints see the same transaction.

Requirements:
  - Local PostgreSQL running with nss schema bootstrapped
  - api/.env configured with DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST, DB_PORT
  - pytest + httpx installed

Usage:
  pytest                        # run all tests
  pytest -m integration         # run only integration tests
  pytest tests/test_bootstrap.py  # run specific file
