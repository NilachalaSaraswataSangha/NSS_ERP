"""
NSS ERP — Application-wide error handlers.

Purpose: every failed request must come back with a `detail` string a
person can read and act on. Before these handlers existed, three classes
of failure reached the browser as bare status codes:

  1. Pydantic validation (422) returned `detail` as a LIST OF OBJECTS,
     e.g. [{"type": "missing", "loc": ["body", "date_of_birth"], ...}].
     Every frontend error slot renders a string, so the user saw the
     literal text "[object Object] [object Object]".
  2. psycopg2 integrity errors (duplicate key, FK, NOT NULL, CHECK)
     were never caught anywhere in api/, so they escaped as an
     unhandled 500 whose body carries no `detail` at all — the UI fell
     through to its "Failed (500)." placeholder.
  3. Any other unexpected exception, likewise.

Design rule: the SERVER owns the wording. Callers already do
`data.detail || "<fallback>"`, so returning a plain string here fixes
every page at once without touching each call site.

These are safety nets, not a licence to skip endpoint-level handling.
Where an endpoint can say something more specific — naming the Sakha and
the number, as helpers.insert_sakha_affiliation does — it still should,
and its HTTPException takes precedence over anything here.

Authority: Tier 5 design decision (2026-09-25) — user-facing error
messages must be meaningful, never a raw status code.
