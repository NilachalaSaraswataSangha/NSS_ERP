"""
Organization API router — Tier 2 endpoints.

8 GET endpoints across the organization table plus Foundation
master_data (for type/status), plus 2 wing-body endpoints. Gated by
require_permission("ORGANIZATION_VIEW") on the Tier 5 branch.
nss_db_backend connects with SELECT-only privileges.

Endpoint groups:
  - Reference:   types, statuses (from master_data)
  - Core:        organizations (list, detail, children)
  - Aggregation: children-stats (recursive family/member/person counts per
                 direct child), stats (same recursive counts collapsed to
                 one row of totals for the requested org's whole subtree)
  - Wings:       wings (Mahila/Kumari/Sevak org + member counts over the
                 subtree), wings/{type}/members (the derived roster).
                 Tier-independent: the same subtree walk serves Sakha,
                 Anchalika, Zilla and Kendra.
  - Navigation:  hierarchy (recursive CTE tree)

Organization type values are stored in Foundation master_data
under category ORGANIZATION_TYPE. Status values use the unified
ERP-wide STATUS category (shared across all modules).

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 3c. WING BODIES (Mahila / Kumari / Sevak Sangha)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# The three wings look symmetric in the ORGANIZATION_TYPE master data and
# are NOT symmetric in how membership works. Getting this wrong would mean
# reporting a confident zero for two wings whose rosters are not knowable
# from the database at all, so the asymmetry is encoded explicitly here
# rather than smoothed over:
#
#   MAHILA_SANGHA  — DERIVED from person attributes. "all female members"
#     (MBR-046); affiliation is automatic the moment a female member's
#     Sakha affiliation is recorded (ORG-BR-096). Deliberately has no
#     membership table — mahila/05_mahila_table_design.md §5.2 declines
#     `mahila_membership` outright ("Mahila Participation != Separate
#     Global Membership"). So a query over person.gender IS the roster,
#     and it is correct today.
#
#   KUMARI_SANGHA  — ENROLLMENT-based. A Kumari holds a kumari_membership
#     row with its own kumari_id. KUM-007 leaves the age boundary
#     explicitly UNFROZEN ("the ERP shall not hard-code an unsupported
#     age limit"), and KUM-004 even allows a Kumari with no NSS
#     membership at all. So "unmarried female members of this Sakha" is
#     NOT the Kumari roster — it is a different, larger set.
#
#   SEVAK_SANGHA   — ENROLLMENT-based. SEV-015: "An authorized user
#     performs the enrollment action." SEV-013 names no gender predicate;
#     the male-only rule is scoped to *event participation*
#     (sevak/04_sevak_participation_rules.md), not enrollment. SEV-014
#     adds no age rule. So no attribute predicate exists to derive from.
#
# Neither kumari_membership nor sevak_participation exists in the schema:
# there is no CREATE TABLE for either anywhere under database/ddl/ (the
# DDL tiers stop at 07_administration). Both are design-only documents.
# Their member_count is therefore None with a note, never 0.
#
# A person is never attached to a wing org row in any case: MBR-038A's
# trigger (05_membership/14_sakha_only_membership_trigger.sql) rejects any
# sangha_sevi.organization_pk or membership_sakha_affiliation.organization_pk
# that is not a SAKHA_SANGHA. That is why wing rosters must be computed
# from the member's Sakha outward, and why no wing-affiliation column is
# added here.

_WING_TYPE_CODES = ("MAHILA_SANGHA", "KUMARI_SANGHA", "SEVAK_SANGHA")

# Wings whose roster is a function of person attributes, and the predicate
# for each. Keep this table the single source of truth: both the summary
# counts and the roster endpoint read it, so they cannot drift apart and
# report a count that the list does not reproduce.
#
# The MAHILA predicate is gender only. No age or marital-status term is
# included because none is documented — MBR-046 says "all female members"
# full stop, and neither the Mahila bye-law (REF-MS-2, which qualifies on
# character and faith, not demographics) nor GOV-BR-033 adds one. Inventing
# an age cutoff here would be exactly the unsupported hard-coding KUM-007
# forbids for Kumari.
