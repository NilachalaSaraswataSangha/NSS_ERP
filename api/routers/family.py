"""
Family API router — Tier 4 read-only + Tier 5 write endpoints.

Read endpoints (GET): family listing, members, head history, graph,
sakha alignment, person families, membership summary, admins.

Write endpoints (POST/DELETE): add member, remove member,
assign/revoke admin, transfer head.

Security — OWNERSHIP-based, with a permission override:

  Family authority derives from a person's RELATIONSHIP to a family, not from
  a system-wide permission. FAMILY_VIEW / FAMILY_MANAGE are the organisational
  override that lets an administrator reach families they do not belong to
  (the org-level family browser in admin.html).

  - View one family (detail, members, head history, graph, admins,
    sakha alignment)         → current member of that family, or FAMILY_VIEW
  - View a person's family /
    membership summary       → self, a current relative, or FAMILY_VIEW
  - List/browse ALL families → FAMILY_VIEW only (admin surface)
  - Create a family          → any authenticated member (self-service: the
                               caller becomes founding member and head)
  - Add / remove member,
    create link              → that family's head or admin, or FAMILY_MANAGE
  - Assign / revoke admin,
    transfer headship        → that family's head only, or FAMILY_MANAGE
  - Audit actor columns populated via UserContext.sangha_sevi_pk

  An ordinary member holds no role and therefore no permissions; they reach
  their own family entirely through the ownership checks above. Gating these
  endpoints on FAMILY_VIEW/FAMILY_MANAGE alone would lock every ordinary
  member out of their own family tree.
