"""
Pydantic response models for the Organization API (Tier 2).

All models exclude audit columns (created_at, updated_at, deleted_at)
per the project's API convention established in Tier 0.

Organization type is sourced from Foundation master_data (category
ORGANIZATION_TYPE). Status is sourced from the unified ERP-wide
STATUS category — a single shared category used by all modules.

Raw psycopg2 returns dictionaries — no ORM objects — so
ConfigDict(from_attributes=True) is unnecessary.

    Aggregate statistics for one organization's whole subtree (itself plus

    Exists because /admin/dashboard-stats answers "what does the *viewer*
    have access to" — right for the admin's own scope card, wrong the
    moment the Org Dashboard is used to drill into a different org (via
    the Organizations tab's "View Dashboard" button, a child-org link in
    the children table, the org switcher, or an #orgDashboard/<pk> deep
    link). Those all show one org's identity while /admin/dashboard-stats
    would silently report the viewer's entire scope underneath it.

    member_count counts active sangha_sevi by HOME Sakha (Parichay Patra
    holders + that Sakha's own PROBATIONARY Darshaks), excluding visiting
    Darshaks whose home is another Sakha; family_count uses the majority-rule
    Sakha assignment (FAM-036). Both use the same descendant-Sakha subtree as
    /children-stats, so the totals here agree with summing that endpoint's
    per-child rows.
    renewals_due counts PENDING nss.membership_renewal_request rows whose
    Sangha Sevi's home Sakha falls in this org's subtree — real today
    (0 until the renewal module writes rows), not a placeholder.
    attendance_pct has no supporting table (darshak_attendance_registration
    is a registration/approval record, not a per-meeting log — there is no
    session table anywhere in the schema), so it is always None with
    attendance_tracked=False rather than a fabricated figure.

    parichay_patra_holders + darshaks is an exact partition of member_count
    (every MEMBERSHIP_TYPE except PROBATIONARY carries a Parichay Patra, and

    never visiting card-holders from another Sakha.

    """
    One wing body (Mahila / Kumari / Sevak Sangha) summarised over an
    organization's subtree.

    Why wings need their own response instead of more columns on
    OrgStatsResponse: that model's wing fields (mahila_sanghas,
    kumari_sanghas, sevak_sanghas) count ORGANIZATION ROWS. This model
    answers the different question "how many PEOPLE are in this wing",
    which for one of the three wings is derived and for the other two is
    not currently answerable at all. Collapsing both into one int per wing
    would make an unavailable figure indistinguishable from zero.

    member_count is None — never 0 — when the figure cannot be computed;
    member_count_note then carries the reason, so the UI renders "—" with
    an explanation instead of a confident and wrong zero. The same
    null-vs-zero discipline the Sakha dashboard already uses for
    permission failures.

    is_derived distinguishes the two fundamentally different wing models
    documented in MBR-046 vs KUM-012/SEV-015:

      MAHILA_SANGHA — derived. Affiliation is automatic: "the moment any
        female member's Sakha affiliation is recorded, she is
        automatically also affiliated to that Sakha's Mahila Sangha"
        (ORG-BR-096), "all female members" (MBR-046). No enrollment
        record exists or should exist — mahila/05_mahila_table_design.md
        §5.2 explicitly declines a mahila_membership table. So the roster
        is a query over person.gender, and is_derived = True.

      KUMARI_SANGHA / SEVAK_SANGHA — enrollment-based, NOT derivable.
        A Kumari holds a kumari_membership row with its own kumari_id
        (KUM-012: only unmarried girls stay active; KUM-007 leaves the
        age boundary deliberately UNFROZEN); a Sevak holds a
        sevak_participation row created by "an authorized user
        [performing] the enrollment action" (SEV-015). Neither is a
        function of person attributes, so no amount of querying produces
        the roster — somebody has to enroll them. Both tables are
        design-only today (no CREATE TABLE for either exists anywhere in
        database/ddl/), hence member_count = None.

    gender_not_recorded_count is a DATA-QUALITY figure, not a wing
    population: person.gender_master_data_pk is NULLable, so a female
    member whose gender was never captured is invisible to the derived
    Mahila roster. Surfacing the count makes that undercount visible
    instead of silently depressing member_count. It is None for the
    non-derived wings, where gender is not the predicate.

class OrgWingSummaryResponse(BaseModel):
    """
    All three wing bodies for one organization's subtree.

    Tier-independent by construction. The underlying walk is the same
    recursive org_tree -> descendant-Sakhas pattern _ORG_STATS_SQL uses,
    so one implementation serves every level the user asked about:

      SAKHA_SANGHA     -> subtree is just itself; its own wings
      ANCHALIKA/ZILLA  -> aggregates its descendant Sakhas' wings
      KENDRA           -> aggregates every Sakha NSS-wide

    Anchalika and Zilla can only ever AGGREGATE: the frozen parent-type
    matrix (ORG-BR-090/091/092) permits wings under SAKHA_SANGHA or (for
    the single central Mahila Sangha) KENDRA only, and ORG-BR-089 makes
    Sakhas the sole legal children of an Anchalika/Zilla. So neither tier
    can own a wing org row, and aggregation is the only meaningful
    reading. Caveat recorded honestly: no rule actually *states* the
    aggregation semantics — ORG-BR-089/090 make it the only possibility,
    but the roll-up itself is this endpoint's interpretation, consistent
    with how /children-stats already aggregates descendant Sakhas.

    For a KENDRA this also happens to be the documented roster of the
    central Mahila Sangha, without special-casing: ORG-BR-096 says a
    female member is affiliated to her Sakha's Mahila Sangha "which is
    understood as part of the Kendra Mahila Sangha". The alternative
    reading (central = only the 9 Parichalana Mandali office-bearers) is
    NOT supported — the Mandali is a governance body, and the bye-law
    quoted in mahila/05_mahila_table_design.md holds that General Body
    membership derives from underlying Mahila Sangha membership.
