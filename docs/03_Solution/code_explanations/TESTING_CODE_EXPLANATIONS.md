## 1. Purpose of this document

This document is the authoritative, current, **per-file** reference for the NSS ERP test suite —
every file under `tests/`. For each file it gives:

- **Requirement** — why the file exists: what problem or need it addresses, and what would
  break or be missing without it.
- **Line-by-line** — a walkthrough of the actual code, block by block, naming real functions,
  variables, and line numbers, so that someone unfamiliar with the code could reconstruct its
  behaviour from the explanation alone.

**Why this is its own document, separate from `API_CODE_EXPLANATIONS.md`:** the files under
`tests/` are FastAPI `TestClient` integration tests. They exercise the API and security-middleware
layers end-to-end — router → Pydantic schema → psycopg2 → a real local PostgreSQL database, and
middleware → response headers/status — through the same ASGI app object that `uvicorn` serves in
production. They are not unit tests of isolated functions; they are the whole application's own
verification harness, spanning every other layer document (`API_CODE_EXPLANATIONS.md`,
`SECURITY_CODE_EXPLANATIONS.md`) without belonging to any single one of them — which is why
testing gets its own dedicated document rather than being folded into whichever layer happens to
be tested by the largest file.

**275 tests total** across 7 files (per `grep -rc "def test_" tests/*.py`; this count does not
yet include `test_membership.py`/`test_data_integrity.py`, added concurrently — see their own
sections below for those files' current counts): `test_bootstrap.py`
(21 — 9 API + 12 UI), `test_foundation.py` (59 — 46 API + 13 UI), `test_organization.py`
(64 — 35 API/hierarchy + 13 pagination + 13 UI + 3 security), `test_security.py` (8),
`test_person.py` (56 — 29 list/detail/addresses/search + 7 pagination + 15 UI + 5 security —
see the breakdown in §2.6), `test_family.py` (67 — 17 list/pagination + 5 detail + 8 members +
7 head-history + 4 security + 13 UI + 4 org-admin-filter + 9 Sakha-alignment — see the
breakdown in §2.7), plus `conftest.py`'s shared fixture (no tests of its own).

---

## 2. Files

### 2.1 `tests/conftest.py`

*(`tests/__init__.py` is folded in here rather than given its own section: it is a single-line
comment, `# tests package`, whose only purpose — like the empty `__init__.py` files under
`api/`— is to make `tests/` importable as a package so pytest can discover and import
`tests/test_*.py` modules correctly when run from the repository root.)*

**Requirement**

Every test file needs a FastAPI `TestClient` wired to the real `api.main.app` object, and
creating a fresh `TestClient` per test would repeatedly trigger the app's lifespan
startup/shutdown for no benefit, since the underlying connection pool is already designed to be
shared. `conftest.py` supplies exactly one `client` fixture, scoped so it's created once per test
*module* and shared by every test function inside that module — this is the fixture every other
test file in `tests/` depends on via its `client` parameter.

**Line-by-line**

```python
"""
NSS ERP — Shared test fixtures.

Provides a FastAPI TestClient backed by the local PostgreSQL database.
Tests run against the same nss.* schema used by the application.

Requirements:
  - Local PostgreSQL running with nss schema bootstrapped
  - api/.env configured with DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST, DB_PORT
  - pytest + httpx installed

Usage:
  pytest                        # run all tests
  pytest -m integration         # run only integration tests
  pytest tests/test_bootstrap.py  # run specific file
"""
```

The module docstring states the fixture provides a `TestClient` "backed by the local
PostgreSQL database," that tests run "against the same nss.* schema used by the application,"
lists the three prerequisites (local Postgres bootstrapped, `api/.env` configured, `pytest` +
`httpx` installed), and gives example invocation commands.

```python
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient

from api.main import app
```

`import pytest` provides `@pytest.fixture`. `from fastapi.testclient import TestClient` — Starlette's
test client, re-exported by FastAPI; it calls the ASGI app in-process, so no real HTTP server or
socket is involved. `from api.main import app` — the real, fully-wired FastAPI application
object — the exact same object Uvicorn would serve in production, including every router and
every piece of security middleware.

The one fixture the whole test suite depends on, lines 24–33:

```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def client():
    """
    FastAPI TestClient scoped to the test module.

    Uses the real database connection (local PostgreSQL).
    The TestClient does not start a server — it calls the ASGI app directly.
    """
    with TestClient(app) as c:
        yield c
```

`scope="module"` means one `TestClient` instance is constructed per test *file* and reused by
every test in it, rather than per individual test function; this is cheaper than
`scope="function"` while still isolating state per file. `with TestClient(app) as c:` is a
context manager that triggers the app's `lifespan` events — nothing runs at entry (the lifespan
handler in `main.py` has no startup code before its `yield`), but on exit — after all tests in
the module have run — it triggers the shutdown half of `lifespan`, i.e. `close_pool()`, cleanly
releasing every pooled database connection.

---

### 2.2 `tests/test_bootstrap.py`

**Requirement**

The 4 Tier 0 Bootstrap endpoints need automated, repeatable verification that they return the
correct shape, the correct data (8 frozen roles, specific role codes, correct `SYSTEM`-role
scoping), and the correct error codes (404 for a nonexistent role, 422 for a malformed UUID) —
otherwise a regression in `api/routers/bootstrap.py` or a change to the seed data would only be
caught by someone manually hitting the endpoints. This file is the executable specification of
the Tier 0 API contract.

**Line-by-line**

```python
"""
NSS ERP — Tier 0 Bootstrap API tests.

Four integration tests corresponding to the four Tier 0 API contracts:
  1. GET /api/v1/bootstrap/health
  2. GET /api/v1/bootstrap/roles
  3. GET /api/v1/bootstrap/permissions
  4. GET /api/v1/bootstrap/roles/{role_pk}/permissions

These tests run against local PostgreSQL (not Neon).
The database must be bootstrapped with DDL + seed before running.
"""

import pytest


pytestmark = pytest.mark.integration
```

The module docstring lists the four contracts under test and states these are integration
tests against local PostgreSQL, requiring the database to already be bootstrapped with DDL +
seed. `pytestmark = pytest.mark.integration` applies the `integration` marker to every test in
the module (equivalent to decorating each test individually), enabling `pytest -m integration`
to select just these tests.

**`class TestHealth:`** (lines 20–29)

```python
class TestHealth:
    """GET /api/v1/bootstrap/health"""

    def test_health_returns_ok(self, client):
        """Health endpoint returns 200 with status 'ok' when DB is reachable."""
        response = client.get("/api/v1/bootstrap/health")
        assert response.status_code == 200
        data = response.json()
        assert data["status"] == "ok"
        assert data["database"] == "connected"
```

Calls `GET /api/v1/bootstrap/health`, asserts `status_code == 200`, and asserts the JSON body's
`data["status"] == "ok"` and `data["database"] == "connected"`. If the local PostgreSQL the test
runner is pointed at is down, this test fails by design — it's exercising the real connection,
not a mock.

**`class TestRoles:`** (lines 32–88, 4 tests)

```python
def test_roles_returns_list(self, client):
    """Roles endpoint returns a non-empty list of active roles."""
    response = client.get("/api/v1/bootstrap/roles")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    roles = response.json()
    assert isinstance(roles, list)
    assert len(roles) >= 8, f"Expected at least 8 frozen roles, got {len(roles)}"
```

`GET /api/v1/bootstrap/roles` returns 200, the body is a `list`, and `len(roles) >= 8` with a
custom failure message reporting the actual count. **Note (loosened from `== 8`):** this was
originally an exact-count pin on the frozen-role seed; it was relaxed to `>= 8` as a defensive
measure so the test keeps passing if a later tier adds roles on top of the 8 frozen ones. As of
this writing `database/seed/00_bootstrap/02_role_master.sql` still seeds exactly 8 roles — the
change is test-robustness hardening, not a reflection of an actual seed-data change.

```python
def test_roles_have_required_fields(self, client):
    """Each role has the expected response fields."""
    response = client.get("/api/v1/bootstrap/roles")
    roles = response.json()
    required_fields = {
        "role_master_pk",
        "role_code",
        "role_name",
        "role_class",
        "scope_level",
        "display_order",
        "is_active",
    }
    for role in roles:
        assert required_fields.issubset(role.keys()), (
            f"Missing fields in role {role.get('role_code', '?')}: "
            f"{required_fields - role.keys()}"
        )
        assert role["is_active"] is True
```

Builds a `required_fields` set of the 7 fields expected on every role (`description` is
deliberately excluded from the *required* set since it's nullable/optional); for every role,
asserts `required_fields.issubset(role.keys())`, with a message naming the offending role and the
exact missing fields if it fails, and separately asserts `role["is_active"] is True` (an identity
check, not `==`, since JSON `true` deserializes to Python `True`).

```python
def test_roles_include_known_codes(self, client):
    """All 8 frozen role codes are present (may include additional roles)."""
    response = client.get("/api/v1/bootstrap/roles")
    codes = {r["role_code"] for r in response.json()}
    expected = {
        "NSS_ERP_ADMIN",
        "NSS_ERP_AUDITOR",
        "NSS_ERP_REPORT_VIEWER",
        "NSS_ERP_KENDRA_ADMIN",
        "NSS_ERP_ANCHALIKA_ADMIN",
        "NSS_ERP_ZILLA_ADMIN",
        "NSS_ERP_SAKHA_ADMIN",
        "NSS_ERP_PATHA_CHAKRA_ADMIN",
    }
    assert expected.issubset(codes), f"Missing role codes: {expected - codes}"
```

Builds `codes = {r["role_code"] for r in response.json()}` and, **loosened from an exact `==`
comparison**, now asserts `expected.issubset(codes)` — the 8 frozen codes must still all be
present, but the set of returned codes is no longer required to match exactly, so extra roles
seeded by a future tier wouldn't fail this test. On failure it reports `expected - codes` (which
of the 8 frozen codes is missing), rather than the old symmetric-difference message (which also
flagged unexpected extras).

```python
def test_system_roles_have_nss_wide_scope(self, client):
    """SYSTEM-class roles have NSS-WIDE scope level."""
    response = client.get("/api/v1/bootstrap/roles")
    system_roles = [r for r in response.json() if r["role_class"] == "SYSTEM"]
    assert len(system_roles) >= 3
    for role in system_roles:
        assert role["scope_level"] == "NSS-WIDE", (
            f"SYSTEM role {role['role_code']} has scope "
            f"'{role['scope_level']}', expected 'NSS-WIDE'"
        )
```

Filters the response to `role_class == "SYSTEM"`, asserts there are **at least** 3 (loosened from
exactly 3 — `ADMIN`, `AUDITOR`, `REPORT_VIEWER` today), and asserts every one has
`scope_level == "NSS-WIDE"` — encoding the business rule that system-class roles are always
organization-wide, never scoped to one organizational tier, while no longer assuming the SYSTEM
role count can never grow.

**`class TestPermissions:`** (lines 91–98)

```python
class TestPermissions:
    """GET /api/v1/bootstrap/permissions"""

    def test_permissions_returns_list(self, client):
        """Permissions endpoint returns 200 with a list (may be empty in Tier 0)."""
        response = client.get("/api/v1/bootstrap/permissions")
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert isinstance(response.json(), list)
```

Only asserts 200 and that the body is a `list`; deliberately does **not** assert emptiness, since
permissions will be added in later tiers and this test must keep passing when that happens.

**`class TestRolePermissions:`** (lines 101–125, 3 tests)

```python
def test_role_permissions_valid_role(self, client):
    """Requesting permissions for a valid role returns 200."""
    # First get a real role_pk
    roles_response = client.get("/api/v1/bootstrap/roles")
    roles = roles_response.json()
    assert len(roles) > 0, "No roles to test against"

    role_pk = roles[0]["role_master_pk"]
    response = client.get(f"/api/v1/bootstrap/roles/{role_pk}/permissions")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert isinstance(response.json(), list)
```

First calls `GET /api/v1/bootstrap/roles`, asserts at least one role exists, takes
`roles[0]["role_master_pk"]` as a real UUID, then calls `GET
/api/v1/bootstrap/roles/{role_pk}/permissions` and asserts 200 with a list body — no hardcoded
UUIDs anywhere, since `gen_random_uuid()` produces a different value every time the database is
seeded.

```python
def test_role_permissions_invalid_role(self, client):
    """Requesting permissions for a nonexistent role returns 404."""
    fake_pk = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    response = client.get(f"/api/v1/bootstrap/roles/{fake_pk}/permissions")
    assert response.status_code == 404
```

Uses the well-formed-but-nonexistent UUID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` and asserts
`status_code == 404`, exercising the router's existence check.

```python
def test_role_permissions_invalid_uuid(self, client):
    """Requesting permissions with a malformed UUID returns 422."""
    response = client.get("/api/v1/bootstrap/roles/not-a-uuid/permissions")
    assert response.status_code == 422
```

Calls the endpoint with the literal path segment `not-a-uuid` and asserts `status_code == 422`,
exercising FastAPI's own `role_pk: UUID` type-coercion failure, with no custom code involved.

### 2.3 `tests/test_foundation.py`

**Requirement**

The 17 Tier 1 Foundation endpoints span 4 subsystems (Master Data, System Configuration,
Geographic, Runtime) and rely on non-trivial behaviours — JOINed parent-context fields, dynamic
optional filters, business-key lookups, deliberately-empty tables, and a deliberately-absent
`change-log` endpoint — every one of which needs its own regression guard. This file is the
executable specification for the entire Tier 1 Foundation API contract, including several
contract-enforcement tests whose entire purpose is to fail loudly if someone reintroduces
something the API contract explicitly excludes (`current_value`, an anonymous `change-log`
endpoint).

**Line-by-line**

```python
"""
NSS ERP — Tier 1 Foundation API tests.

Integration tests for the 17 Foundation GET endpoints across 11 tables.
Runs against local PostgreSQL (not Neon). The database must be
bootstrapped with DDL + seed before running.

Endpoint groups tested:
  1. Master Data:   categories, master-data
  2. System Config: settings, sequences
  3. Geographic:    countries, states, districts, cities,
                    postal-codes, postal-code-mappings
  4. Runtime:       documents

field_change_log is intentionally not exposed in Tier 1 (deferred to
Tier 5 authenticated audit API).
"""

import pytest


pytestmark = pytest.mark.integration

BASE = "/api/v1/foundation"
```

The module docstring states this covers "the 17 Foundation GET endpoints across 11 tables,"
lists the four endpoint groups, and explicitly notes `field_change_log` is "not exposed in
Tier 1 (deferred to Tier 5 authenticated audit API)." `pytestmark = pytest.mark.integration` is
the same pattern as `test_bootstrap.py`. `BASE = "/api/v1/foundation"` — every test URL in the
file is built by string-formatting this constant, so a prefix change only needs to happen in
one place.

#### `TestCategories` (lines 32–77, 6 tests)

The full, representative body — the fields test also checks `is_active`:

```python
def test_list_has_required_fields(self, client):
    """Each category has the expected response fields."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/categories")
    required = {
        "master_category_pk", "category_code", "category_name",
        "description", "display_order", "is_active",
    }
    for cat in r.json():
        assert required.issubset(cat.keys()), (
            f"Missing fields in category {cat.get('category_code', '?')}: "
            f"{required - cat.keys()}"
        )
        assert cat["is_active"] is True
```

Checks the 6-field `required` set against every returned category, with a failure message
naming the offending category and its missing fields, and separately asserts `is_active is True`.
The other 5 tests in this class follow the same list/detail/404/422 shape and differ only in what
they pin down:

| Test | Lines | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `test_list_returns_200` | 35–41 | `GET /categories` → 200, list, `len(data) > 0` ("Expected seeded categories") |
| `test_list_all_active` | 57–60 | re-checks `cat["is_active"] is True` standalone, for every category |
| `test_detail_valid_pk` | 62–68 | fetches the list, takes `cats[0]["master_category_pk"]`, `GET /categories/{pk}` → 200, returned `master_category_pk` matches |
| `test_detail_fake_pk_returns_404` | 70–73 | `GET /categories/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` → 404 |
| `test_detail_bad_uuid_returns_422` | 75–77 | `GET /categories/not-a-uuid` → 422 |

#### `TestMasterData` (lines 80–144, 8 tests)

`test_list_has_required_fields` (lines 91–104) checks a JOINed field set — master-data rows
carry their parent category's context inline:

```python
def test_list_has_required_fields(self, client):
    """Each master data value has expected fields including JOINed category context."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/master-data")
    required = {
        "master_data_pk", "master_category_pk",
        "category_code", "category_name",
        "value_code", "value_name",
        "description", "display_order", "is_active",
    }
    for md in r.json():
        assert required.issubset(md.keys()), (
            f"Missing fields in master data {md.get('value_code', '?')}: "
            f"{required - md.keys()}"
        )
```

Three filter tests exercise the endpoint's dynamic optional filters:

```python
def test_filter_by_category_code(self, client):
    """Filtering by category_code returns only matching values."""
    # Get a known category code
    cats = client.get(f"{BASE}/categories").json()
    code = cats[0]["category_code"]
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/master-data", params={"category_code": code})
    assert r.status_code == 200
    for md in r.json():
        assert md["category_code"] == code
```

Fetches a real category code from `/categories`, filters `/master-data` by it, and asserts
**every** returned item's `category_code` matches (not just spot-checking one).

```python
def test_filter_by_category_pk(self, client):
    """Filtering by category_pk returns only matching values."""
    cats = client.get(f"{BASE}/categories").json()
    pk = cats[0]["master_category_pk"]
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/master-data", params={"category_pk": pk})
    assert r.status_code == 200
    for md in r.json():
        assert md["master_category_pk"] == pk
```

Does the same with the `category_pk` query param instead of `category_code`.

```python
def test_filter_nonexistent_category_returns_empty(self, client):
    """Filtering by a category code with no values returns empty list."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/master-data", params={"category_code": "ZZZZZZZ_FAKE"})
    assert r.status_code == 200
    assert r.json() == []
```

Asserts filtering by a fabricated code `"ZZZZZZZ_FAKE"` returns `200` with body `== []` — a query
with zero matches is a successful empty result, not a 404, per REST convention.

The remaining tests mirror `TestCategories`'s list/detail/404/422 shape:

| Test | Lines | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `test_list_returns_200` | 83–89 | `GET /master-data` → 200, list, `len(data) > 0` ("Expected seeded master data values") |
| `test_detail_valid_pk` | 131–137 | `GET /master-data/{pk}` → 200, returned `master_data_pk` matches |
| `test_detail_fake_pk_returns_404` | 139–141 | all-zero UUID → 404 |
| `test_detail_bad_uuid_returns_422` | 143–144 | `"not-a-uuid"` → 422 |

#### `TestSettings` (lines 152–185, 4 tests)

```python
def test_lookup_by_key(self, client):
    """Looking up a setting by its business key returns 200."""
    settings = client.get(f"{BASE}/settings").json()
    key = settings[0]["setting_key"]
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/settings/{key}")
    assert r.status_code == 200
    assert r.json()["setting_key"] == key
```

Fetches a real `setting_key` string from the list and confirms the business-key detail lookup
(`/settings/{key}`, a string path, not a UUID) returns it.

```python
def test_lookup_nonexistent_key_returns_404(self, client):
    """Looking up a nonexistent setting key returns 404."""
    assert client.get(f"{BASE}/settings/ZZZZZ_FAKE_KEY").status_code == 404
```

Confirms an unknown key string returns 404 rather than 422 (since any string is a syntactically
valid key).

The two remaining tests are the familiar list/required-fields shape:

| Test | Lines | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `test_list_returns_200` | 155–161 | `GET /settings` → 200, list, `len(data) > 0` ("Expected seeded system settings") |
| `test_list_has_required_fields` | 163–173 | `required = {"system_setting_pk", "setting_key", "setting_value", "description", "data_type", "is_active"}` is a subset of every returned setting's keys |

#### `TestSequences` (lines 188–216, 3 tests)

The contract-enforcement test — this is the one that must keep failing loudly if `current_value`
is ever re-exposed:

```python
def test_current_value_not_exposed(self, client):
    """current_value is infrastructure state — must NOT be in the response."""
    for seq in client.get(f"{BASE}/sequences").json():
        assert "current_value" not in seq, (
            f"current_value leaked in sequence {seq.get('sequence_code', '?')}"
        )
```

Iterates every returned sequence and asserts the key is entirely absent from the dict (not merely
`None`), guarding against `current_value` being accidentally re-added to either the SQL SELECT or
`SequenceResponse`.

| Test | Lines | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `test_list_returns_200` | 191–197 | `GET /sequences` → 200, list, `len(data) > 0` ("Expected seeded ID sequences") |
| `test_list_has_required_fields` | 199–209 | `required = {"id_sequence_master_pk", "sequence_code", "sequence_name", "prefix", "padding_length", "description", "is_active"}` is a subset of every returned sequence's keys (note: `current_value` deliberately absent from this set too) |

#### `TestCountries`, `TestStates`, `TestDistricts` (lines 224–333, 5 tests each)

These three classes share the same shape: list-returns-200-non-empty, required-fields (for
`TestStates`/`TestDistricts` this specifically checks the JOINed parent fields), filter-by-parent-
PK, detail-by-valid-PK, and detail-by-fake-PK-returns-404. `TestCountries` additionally has
`test_detail_bad_uuid_returns_422`. `TestStates` is shown in full below as the representative;
`TestCountries` and `TestDistricts` differ only in field names and are tabulated afterward.

```python
def test_list_has_joined_country_fields(self, client):
    """Each state includes country_code and country_name via JOIN."""
    required = {
        "state_pk", "country_pk", "country_code", "country_name",
        "state_code", "state_name", "display_order", "is_active",
    }
    for s in client.get(f"{BASE}/states").json():
        assert required.issubset(s.keys())
```

```python
def test_filter_by_country_pk(self, client):
    """Filtering by country_pk returns only states in that country."""
    countries = client.get(f"{BASE}/countries").json()
    cpk = countries[0]["country_pk"]
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/states", params={"country_pk": cpk})
    assert r.status_code == 200
    for s in r.json():
        assert s["country_pk"] == cpk
```

The required-fields test proves the `/states` list is JOINed against `countries` so each row
carries its parent's `country_code`/`country_name` inline (no separate lookup needed by callers).
The filter test verifies **every** returned row's `country_pk` matches the filter value, not just
that the call succeeded.

The remaining tests in `TestStates` are the plain list/detail/404 shape (`test_list_returns_200`
lines 260–264, `test_detail_valid_pk` lines 284–289, `test_detail_fake_pk_returns_404` lines
291–293).

`TestCountries` (lines 224–254) and `TestDistricts` (lines 296–333) follow the identical shape,
differing only here:

| Class | Lines | Required-fields test | JOINed parent fields | Filter test | Extra test |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `TestCountries` | 224–254 | `test_list_has_required_fields` (234–240) | none — countries have no parent | — (no filter; countries are the top of the hierarchy) | `test_detail_bad_uuid_returns_422` (253–254): `"not-a-uuid"` → 422 |
| `TestDistricts` | 296–333 | `test_list_has_joined_state_name` (305–313): `required = {"district_pk", "state_pk", "state_name", "district_code", "district_name", "display_order", "is_active"}` | `state_name` | `test_filter_by_state_pk` (315–322): filters `/districts` by `state_pk`, asserts every returned `d["state_pk"] == spk` | — |

#### `TestCities` (lines 336–351, 2 tests)

Documented as "intentionally empty at Tier 1":

```python
def test_list_returns_200(self, client):
    """Cities endpoint returns 200 (empty list — no seed data by design)."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/cities")
    assert r.status_code == 200
    assert isinstance(r.json(), list)
```

Only asserts 200 and a list type, no non-emptiness assertion.

```python
def test_filter_by_district_pk_returns_200(self, client):
    """Filtering by district_pk returns 200 even when empty."""
    districts = client.get(f"{BASE}/districts").json()
    dpk = districts[0]["district_pk"]
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/cities", params={"district_pk": dpk})
    assert r.status_code == 200
    assert isinstance(r.json(), list)
```

Confirms filtering by a real `district_pk` still returns 200 with a list (empty), i.e. the filter
code path doesn't error out on zero rows.

#### `TestPostalCodes` (lines 354–389, 4 tests)

```python
def test_list_has_required_fields(self, client):
    """If postal codes are seeded, verify response shape."""
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/postal-codes").json()
    if len(data) > 0:
        required = {
            "postal_code_pk", "country_pk", "state_pk",
            "state_name", "postal_code", "post_office_name", "is_active",
        }
        for pc in data:
            assert required.issubset(pc.keys())
```

Written defensively — the field-shape check only runs `if len(data) > 0:`, since postal codes
may or may not be seeded.

```python
def test_filter_by_country_pk(self, client):
    """Filtering by country_pk returns 200."""
    countries = client.get(f"{BASE}/countries").json()
    cpk = countries[0]["country_pk"]
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/postal-codes", params={"country_pk": cpk})
    assert r.status_code == 200
    for pc in r.json():
        assert pc["country_pk"] == cpk
```

```python
def test_filter_by_state_pk(self, client):
    """Filtering by state_pk returns 200."""
    states = client.get(f"{BASE}/states").json()
    spk = states[0]["state_pk"]
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/postal-codes", params={"state_pk": spk})
    assert r.status_code == 200
    for pc in r.json():
        assert pc["state_pk"] == spk
```

Each verifies every returned row's corresponding FK matches the filter — `test_filter_by_
country_pk` for `country_pk`, `test_filter_by_state_pk` for `state_pk`. `test_list_returns_200`
(lines 357–360) just asserts 200 + list type, the same defensive stance as the required-fields
test above.

#### `TestPostalCodeMappings` (lines 392–399, 1 test)

```python
def test_list_returns_200(self, client):
    """Mappings endpoint returns 200 (empty — no city/village data yet)."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/postal-code-mappings")
    assert r.status_code == 200
    assert isinstance(r.json(), list)
```

Documented as "empty at Tier 1" — only checks 200 + list type, no filter tests (there's no seeded
city/village or mapping data to filter against yet).

#### `TestDocuments` (lines 407–420, 2 tests)

```python
def test_list_returns_200(self, client):
    """Documents endpoint returns 200 (empty — runtime data)."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/documents")
    assert r.status_code == 200
    assert isinstance(r.json(), list)
```

```python
def test_filter_by_type_code_returns_200(self, client):
    """Filtering by document_type_code returns 200 even when empty."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/documents", params={"document_type_code": "PHOTO"})
    assert r.status_code == 200
    assert isinstance(r.json(), list)
```

Documented as "intentionally empty at Tier 1" — both tests only assert 200 + list type; the
second filters by `document_type_code="PHOTO"`.

#### `TestChangeLogNotExposed` (lines 428–442, 1 test)

```python
def test_change_log_endpoint_returns_404(self, client):
    """
    /api/v1/foundation/change-log must NOT exist.

    Audit data is deferred to Tier 5 authenticated API.
    If this test fails, someone added an anonymous audit endpoint.
    """
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/change-log")
    assert r.status_code in (404, 405), (
        f"change-log endpoint should not exist in Tier 1, "
        f"got status {r.status_code}"
    )
```

Calls `GET /api/v1/foundation/change-log` and asserts `status_code in (404, 405)`, with a failure
message stating "change-log endpoint should not exist in Tier 1." This is the test that directly
enforces the module docstring's stated exclusion of `field_change_log` from the anonymous API.

#### `TestFoundationUI` (lines 450–457, 1 test)

```python
def test_foundation_page_returns_200(self, client):
    """The /foundation route serves HTML."""
    r = client.get("/foundation")
    assert r.status_code == 200
    assert "text/html" in r.headers.get("content-type", "")
```

Calls `GET /foundation` (no `/api/v1` prefix — a page route, not an API endpoint) and asserts 200
with `"text/html"` in the `Content-Type` header, verifying `api/main.py`'s conditional
`serve_foundation()` route actually works end-to-end.

### 2.4 `tests/test_security.py`

**Requirement**

The security middleware stack (`api/middleware.py`'s headers, `api/main.py`'s rate limiting and
CORS wiring — see `SECURITY_CODE_EXPLANATIONS.md`) is exactly the kind of cross-cutting behaviour
that's easy to silently break — adding a new route, changing middleware order, or removing
`SlowAPIMiddleware` by accident would not fail any functional test in `test_bootstrap.py` or
`test_foundation.py`, since those only check response *bodies*, not headers or throttling. This
file exists specifically to test the non-functional, security-relevant behaviour of every
response: headers present, headers scoped correctly, rate limiting actually enforced (not just
configured), and CORS refusing unconfigured origins. It directly caught a real bug during
development — `SlowAPIMiddleware` had been configured but never added to the app, so rate
limiting silently did nothing.

**Line-by-line**

```python
"""
NSS ERP — Security middleware tests.

Verifies that security controls added across all tiers actually work:
  1. Security headers are present on every response
  2. Cache-Control is scoped to API routes (not static assets)
  3. Rate limiting returns 429 after threshold
  4. CORS responds correctly to preflight and same-origin requests
  5. DISABLE_DOCS toggle hides OpenAPI endpoints

These tests run against the FastAPI TestClient (no network).
"""

import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient


pytestmark = pytest.mark.integration
```

The module docstring enumerates the 5 things under test: security headers present on every
response; `Cache-Control` scoped to API routes only; rate limiting returns 429 past threshold;
CORS behaves correctly for preflight and same-origin requests; the `DISABLE_DOCS` toggle
(mentioned in the docstring, though not directly asserted by a dedicated test in this file —
it's exercised implicitly by every other test still passing with docs enabled in the test
environment). `TestClient` is imported separately from the shared `client` fixture, because
`TestRateLimiting` needs its own isolated client instance.

**The rate-limiter reset fixture used to live here, autoused for this file only — it now lives
in `tests/conftest.py` instead, applying to every test in the suite:**

```python
@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def _reset_rate_limiter():
    """
    Reset the rate limiter's in-memory storage before every test.

    slowapi's Limiter is a module-level singleton (imported from
    api.main), shared across the entire pytest process — not scoped
    per test file. Without this reset, request counts accumulate
    across every test file in the run, and a test file that makes many
    requests (e.g. a dynamic-discovery-heavy suite looping over
    /members) can push the 60/minute budget over the edge and start
    getting 429s in later, unrelated tests. This used to live only in
    test_security.py, which reset the limiter for its own tests but
    left every other file's requests accumulating against the same
    global counter.
    """
    limiter.reset()
    yield
```

**Why this moved (a real bug this fixed):** as originally written, `_reset_rate_limiter` was
`autouse=True` only within `test_security.py`, so it reset the limiter before *that file's* own
tests but did nothing for any other file. Because `limiter` is a process-wide singleton (the
exact object `api/main.py` registers on the app), every request any test file made — across the
*entire* pytest run — counted against the same 60/minute budget. This was latent until
`tests/test_membership.py`'s test suite shifted to fully-dynamic seed discovery (looping
`GET /members` repeatedly inside helpers like `_get_all_members()`), which pushed the cumulative
request count over the limit within a single run. The symptom wasn't a clean 429 failure on an
obviously-related test — it cascaded into confusing, unrelated-looking failures: `KeyError: 0`
in `TestJourneyEvents::test_journey_has_required_fields` (a 429 JSON body is a dict, and
`_get_first_member_pk()` does `data[0]` on it), `TypeError: string indices must be integers, not
'str'` in several other `TestJourneyEvents` tests (iterating a 429 dict's string *keys* as if
they were member records, then indexing a string with a string key), and a flat `429 == 200` in
`test_membership_api_has_security_headers` at the very end of the file, once the budget was
fully exhausted. Moving the fixture to `tests/conftest.py` gives every test — regardless of
which file it's in — a clean rate-limit slate; `test_security.py`'s own `TestRateLimiting` test
(which deliberately floods 61 requests to *trigger* a 429 on purpose) still works exactly as
before, since it now inherits the same reset from `conftest.py` rather than defining its own
copy. `test_security.py` no longer imports `limiter` at module level — its one remaining usage
(inside the 61-request test) does its own local `from api.main import app, limiter` import.

**A second, unrelated bug this same investigation surfaced:**
`test_membership.py::TestAnumatiPatra::test_regular_member_has_historical_expired_ap` used to
grab the *first* `REGULAR`-type member via `_get_member_by_type(client, "REGULAR")` and assert
it had a historical `EXPIRED` Anumati Patra — an assumption that held for the original seed's
`SS1` (promoted from Probationary), but not for every `REGULAR` member added since (e.g. `SS7`,
admitted straight to Regular without ever holding an Anumati Patra). Per business rule
**MBR-019C**, the Probationary/Darshaka stage — and its associated Anumati Patra — is mandatory
only for non-youth applicants; an applicant with a Kishor Puja or Kumari Sangha background may
be admitted directly to Regular at the sanctioning Sangha President's discretion, with no
Anumati Patra history at all. Fixed the test to search across *all* `REGULAR` members for one
that actually has a historical `EXPIRED` AP, skip-guarded if none exist — matching the pattern
the neighboring `test_any_member_has_expired_ap` already used.

#### `TestSecurityHeaders` (lines 30–68, 5 tests)

```python
def test_api_response_has_security_headers(self, client):
    """Every API response must include the four core security headers."""
    response = client.get("/api/v1/bootstrap/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200

    assert response.headers["X-Content-Type-Options"] == "nosniff"
    assert response.headers["X-Frame-Options"] == "DENY"
    assert response.headers["Referrer-Policy"] == "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    assert "camera=()" in response.headers["Permissions-Policy"]
    assert "microphone=()" in response.headers["Permissions-Policy"]
    assert "geolocation=()" in response.headers["Permissions-Policy"]
```

Calls `/api/v1/bootstrap/health`, asserts 200, then asserts the exact literal values of
`X-Content-Type-Options` (`"nosniff"`), `X-Frame-Options` (`"DENY"`), `Referrer-Policy`
(`"strict-origin-when-cross-origin"`), and that all three `Permissions-Policy` directives
(`"camera=()"`, `"microphone=()"`, `"geolocation=()"`) are present as substrings of that single
header value.

```python
def test_api_response_has_cache_control_no_store(self, client):
    """API responses under /api/ must have Cache-Control: no-store."""
    response = client.get("/api/v1/bootstrap/health")
    assert response.headers.get("Cache-Control") == "no-store"
```

Asserts `response.headers.get("Cache-Control") == "no-store"` for an `/api/*` route.

```python
def test_static_response_no_cache_control_no_store(self, client):
    """Non-API responses (frontend) must NOT have Cache-Control: no-store."""
    response = client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    # Static/frontend responses should not force no-store
    assert response.headers.get("Cache-Control") != "no-store"
```

The inverse regression guard: calls `/` (the frontend) and asserts `Cache-Control` is **not**
`"no-store"`, catching any future change that applies the no-cache rule globally instead of
scoping it to `/api/*`.

```python
def test_x_xss_protection_not_present(self, client):
    """X-XSS-Protection is obsolete and must NOT be set."""
    response = client.get("/api/v1/bootstrap/health")
    assert "X-XSS-Protection" not in response.headers
```

Asserts the header key `"X-XSS-Protection"` is entirely absent from the response, enforcing the
documented decision in `api/middleware.py` never to add this obsolete header.

```python
def test_security_headers_on_frontend_route(self, client):
    """Frontend routes also get the four core security headers."""
    response = client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.headers["X-Content-Type-Options"] == "nosniff"
    assert response.headers["X-Frame-Options"] == "DENY"
    assert response.headers["Referrer-Policy"] == "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
```

Confirms the same three core headers also appear on `/`, proving the middleware is genuinely
global and not scoped only to `/api/*` routes (unlike `Cache-Control`, which is intentionally
scoped).

#### `TestRateLimiting` (lines 71–94, 1 test)

```python
def test_rate_limit_returns_429(self, client):
    """
    Exceeding the rate limit must return 429 Too Many Requests.

    The default limit is 60/minute. We send 61 requests and verify
    the last one is rejected. TestClient is in-process (no network),
    so this completes in milliseconds.
    """
    from api.main import app, limiter

    with TestClient(app) as test_client:
        last_status = None
        for i in range(61):
            resp = test_client.get("/api/v1/bootstrap/health")
            last_status = resp.status_code
            if last_status == 429:
                break

        assert last_status == 429, (
            "After 61 requests, rate limit (60/minute) should return 429"
        )
```

Re-imports `app` and `limiter` locally and constructs its own `with TestClient(app) as
test_client:` rather than using the shared module-scoped `client` fixture, to keep this test's
request burst isolated from other tests in the file. Loops up to 61 times calling `GET
/api/v1/bootstrap/health`, tracking `last_status`, and `break`s as soon as it sees `429` — since
the configured default is `60/minute`, the 61st request in the same window is expected to be
rejected. Asserts `last_status == 429` with a message naming the expected limit. Because
`TestClient` calls the ASGI app in-process with no real network I/O, all 61 requests complete in
milliseconds.

#### `TestCORS` (lines 97–124, 2 tests)

```python
def test_no_cors_headers_without_configured_origins(self, client):
    """
    When CORS_ORIGINS is empty (default), no CORS headers should
    appear even if the request includes an Origin header.
    """
    response = client.get(
        "/api/v1/bootstrap/health",
        headers={"Origin": "https://evil.example.com"},
    )
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" not in response.headers
```

Sends `GET /api/v1/bootstrap/health` with an `Origin: https://evil.example.com` header and
asserts `"Access-Control-Allow-Origin"` is **not** present in the response — confirming that with
`CORS_ORIGINS` unset (the local/test default), `CORSMiddleware` was never added to the app at all
(per `api/main.py`'s `if settings.CORS_ORIGINS:` guard), so no origin — malicious or not — gets
any CORS allowance.

```python
def test_cors_preflight_without_configured_origins(self, client):
    """
    OPTIONS preflight without configured origins should not
    return CORS allow headers.
    """
    response = client.options(
        "/api/v1/bootstrap/health",
        headers={
            "Origin": "https://evil.example.com",
            "Access-Control-Request-Method": "GET",
        },
    )
    assert "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" not in response.headers
```

Sends an `OPTIONS` preflight request (with `Origin` and `Access-Control-Request-Method: GET`
headers) to the same endpoint and asserts the same absence of `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`,
confirming the secure-by-default behaviour also holds for the preflight path browsers use before
an actual cross-origin request.

### 2.5 `tests/test_organization.py`

**Requirement**

The 7 Tier 2 Organization endpoints span 3 tables and rely on non-trivial behaviours —
8-way JOINed queries with 6 LEFT JOINs for nullable geographic FKs, a recursive CTE for
hierarchy traversal with a depth guard, combinable type/status/pagination filters, a
parent-existence-checked children endpoint, a multi-CTE aggregate `/children-stats` endpoint
(dynamic FAM-036 majority-rule family counting), and a 36-field response model — every one of
which needs its own regression guard. This file is the executable specification for the
entire Tier 2 Organization API contract, plus UI structure tests for the Organization
Verification UI page and security-header verification for the Organization endpoints.
**72 tests across 8 classes** — this section supersedes an earlier version of this doc that
predated the "org-to-master-data migration": organization type and lifecycle status values
used to live in dedicated Organization tables with fields named `organization_status_pk` /
`organization_status_code` / `organization_status_name`; they now come from Foundation's
unified `master_data` (category `ORGANIZATION_TYPE` for types, the unified ERP-wide `STATUS`
category for statuses), so the response field names collapsed to the generic `status_pk` /
`status_code` / `status_name`, and the seeded counts grew (8 → 10 frozen types, 6 → 13
statuses) as the unified status vocabulary was built out for reuse by later tiers. **As of
Tier 4** the Tier 4 Family + Membership verification seed data adds many more organizations,
types, and statuses on top of the original Tier 2 freeze (3 organizations, 10 types, 13
statuses) — most of `TestOrganizationTypes`/`TestStatuses`/`TestOrganizations`/`TestHierarchy`'s
exact-count (`==`) assertions were loosened to at-least/subset (`>=`/`.issubset(...)`)
assertions so the same tests keep passing as seed data grows, rather than being re-pinned to a
new exact number each time a later tier adds seed rows. An 8th test class,
`TestChildrenStats`, was added for the new `/children-stats` endpoint (see below).

**Line-by-line**

```python
"""
NSS ERP — Tier 2 Organization API tests.

Integration tests for the 6 Organization GET endpoints.
Organization type values come from Foundation master_data
(category ORGANIZATION_TYPE). Status values come from the
unified ERP-wide STATUS category.
Runs against local PostgreSQL (not Neon). The database must be
bootstrapped with DDL + seed before running.

Endpoint groups tested:
  1. Reference Data: types, statuses (from master_data)
  2. Organizations:  list (with filters), detail, children
  3. Hierarchy:      recursive CTE tree
  4. UI Route:       /organization serves HTML
"""

import pytest


pytestmark = pytest.mark.integration

BASE = "/api/v1/organization"
FAKE_UUID = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

Module docstring states "6 Organization GET endpoints," explicitly calls out that type values
come from Foundation `master_data` (category `ORGANIZATION_TYPE`) and status values come from
the unified ERP-wide `STATUS` category, lists the four test groups, and notes the database
prerequisites. **Known stale docstring:** this module docstring was not updated when
`/children-stats` was added — it still says "6 Organization GET endpoints" and its four-group
list has no "Children Stats" entry, even though an 8th test class (`TestChildrenStats`, 8
tests, added at the bottom of the file after `TestOrganizationSecurity`) now exercises exactly
that endpoint. `pytestmark = pytest.mark.integration` is the same pattern as the other test
files. `BASE` and `FAKE_UUID` (lines 23–24) are module-level constants to avoid
repetition — identical to the approach in `test_foundation.py`.

#### `TestOrganizationTypes` (lines 32–74, 4 tests)

```python
def test_list_includes_frozen_types(self, client):
    """All 13 frozen organization types are present (may include more)."""
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/types").json()
    assert len(data) >= 13
    codes = {t["organization_type_code"] for t in data}
    expected = {
        "KENDRA", "NILACHALA_KUTIRA", "SMRUTI_MANDIRA",
        "ANCHALIKA_SANGHA", "ZILLA_SANGHA", "SAKHA_SANGHA",
        "SAKHA_ASANA", "PARIBARIK_ASANA", "PARIBARIK_SANGHA",
        "PATHA_CHAKRA", "KUMARI_SANGHA", "SEVAK_SANGHA",
        "MAHILA_SANGHA",
    }
    assert expected.issubset(codes), f"Missing org types: {expected - codes}"
```

Renamed from `test_list_returns_10_frozen_types` (which asserted `len(data) == 10` and
`codes == expected` with a 10-code set). As of Tier 4 the `ORGANIZATION_TYPE` category grew to
at least 13 values — `KUMARI_SANGHA`, `SEVAK_SANGHA`, and `MAHILA_SANGHA` were added alongside
the original 10 — so the test was loosened from an exact-match (`==`, which would fail the
moment a 14th type is ever seeded) to `len(data) >= 13` plus `expected.issubset(codes)`
(asserts the 13 known codes are all present, without forbidding more).

| Test | Lines | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `test_list_returns_200` | 35–41 | `GET /types` → 200, non-empty list ("Expected 9 seeded organization types" — a stale docstring left over from an earlier count; the assertion itself is just `len(data) > 0`, so it still passes) |
| `test_list_has_required_fields` | 43–55 | 6-field `required` set (`organization_type_pk`, `organization_type_code`, `organization_type_name`, `description`, `sort_order`, `is_active`) is a subset of every returned type's keys; asserts `is_active is True` |
| `test_list_ordered_by_sort_order` | 71–74 | `sort_order` values are in ascending order |

The structure mirrors `TestFoundationCountries` / `TestFoundationStates` — the same
four-test pattern (200, fields, count+codes, ordering) applied to a different reference
table, now backed by `master_data` rows instead of a dedicated `organization_type` table.

#### `TestStatuses` (lines 78–118, 4 tests)

Renamed from the earlier `TestOrganizationStatuses` to `TestStatuses` to match the field
rename described above — the class now documents "the unified ERP-wide STATUS category,"
not an organization-specific status table:

```python
def test_list_includes_org_statuses(self, client):
    """Organization-scoped lifecycle statuses include the 7 core statuses."""
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/statuses").json()
    assert len(data) >= 7
    codes = {s["status_code"] for s in data}
    expected = {
        "PROPOSED", "APPROVED", "ACTIVE",
        "INACTIVE", "SUSPENDED", "DISSOLVED", "ARCHIVED",
    }
    assert expected.issubset(codes), f"Missing org statuses: {expected - codes}"
```

**Resolved (was "Known broken test" in an earlier version of this doc):** an earlier pass of
this file's `/statuses` endpoint gained a `master_data.applicable_modules TEXT[]` filter
(`'ORGANIZATION' = ANY(applicable_modules) OR applicable_modules IS NULL`), narrowing the
response from all 13-of-16 unified `STATUS` values down to the 7 Organization-applicable ones
(Proposed/Approved/Active/Inactive/Suspended/Dissolved/Archived) — at that point this test
still asserted the old unfiltered `len(data) == 13` / exact 13-code set and would have failed.
This diff fixes exactly that: the test is renamed `test_list_includes_org_statuses`, asserts
`len(data) >= 7`, and checks the 7 Organization-applicable codes via `.issubset(...)` rather
than `==`, so it now passes against the filtered endpoint and tolerates future growth of the
Organization-applicable subset.

```python
def test_list_has_required_fields(self, client):
    """Each status has the expected response fields."""
    required = {
        "status_pk", "status_code",
        "status_name", "description",
        "sort_order", "is_active",
    }
    for s in client.get(f"{BASE}/statuses").json():
        assert required.issubset(s.keys()), (
            f"Missing fields in status {s.get('status_code', '?')}: "
            f"{required - s.keys()}"
        )
```

The field set uses the generic `status_pk` / `status_code` / `status_name` names — not
`organization_status_*` — confirming statuses are a plain `master_data` projection with no
organization-specific columns at all.

| Test | Lines | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `test_list_returns_200` | 81–86 | `GET /statuses` → 200, non-empty list |
| `test_list_ordered_by_sort_order` | 113–118 | `sort_order` values ascending |

#### `TestOrganizations` (lines 125–338, 27 tests)

The largest test class in the file, covering list, filters, detail, geographic resolution,
contact-field content, and pagination:

```python
def test_list_has_required_fields(self, client):
    """Each organization has expected fields including JOINed context."""
    required = {
        "organization_pk", "organization_id", "organization_name",
        "organization_code",
        "organization_type_pk", "organization_type_code",
        "organization_type_name",
        "status_pk", "status_code",
        "status_name",
        "parent_organization_pk", "parent_organization_name",
        "address_line_1", "address_line_2",
        "phone_number", "mobile_number", "email", "org_email",
        "website_url", "org_website_url",
        "youtube_channel_url", "org_youtube_channel_url",
        "district_pk", "district_name",
        "state_pk", "state_name",
        "country_pk", "country_name",
        "city_village_pk", "city_village_name",
        "postal_code_pk", "postal_code",
        "latitude", "longitude",
        "is_active",
    }
    for org in client.get(f"{BASE}/organizations").json():
        assert required.issubset(org.keys()), (
            f"Missing fields in org {org.get('organization_code', '?')}: "
            f"{required - org.keys()}"
        )
```

Checks the fields of `OrganizationResponse` are present, including all JOINed context
fields from type, status (now `status_pk`/`status_code`/`status_name`, not
`organization_status_*`), parent, and 5 geographic tables, plus 4 contact fields (phone,
mobile, email + org_email) and 4 online-presence fields (website/YouTube for both NSS-level
and org-specific). This is the most comprehensive field check in the entire test suite —
Foundation's largest response model has 8 fields; Organization's has over 30. This test's
assertion (`issubset`, not `==`) was already seed-count-tolerant and needed no change.

**Loosened for Tier 4 seed growth** — with Tier 4's Family + Membership verification seed data
now populating many more organizations than the original Tier 2 freeze (3 roots: KEN, NKT,
SMR), a cluster of tests that used to pin exact counts or literal shared values now use
`>=`/`is not None`/dynamic lookups, several with a `pytest.skip(...)` guard for the case where
a particular seeded org type isn't present:

```python
def test_list_includes_known_orgs(self, client):
    """Organization list has root organizations (at least 3)."""
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/organizations").json()
    assert len(data) >= 3, f"Expected at least 3 orgs, got {len(data)}"
    # Verify root orgs exist (parent=NULL)
    roots = [o for o in data if o["parent_organization_pk"] is None]
    assert len(roots) >= 1, "Expected at least 1 root organization"


def test_list_has_roots_and_children(self, client):
    """At least 3 root organizations (parent=NULL) exist."""
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/organizations").json()
    roots = [o for o in data if o["parent_organization_pk"] is None]
    assert len(roots) >= 3, f"Expected at least 3 roots, got {len(roots)}"
```

`test_list_includes_known_orgs` (renamed from `test_list_returns_3_seeded_orgs`, which asserted
`len(data) == 3` and `codes == {"KEN", "NKT", "SMR"}`) and `test_list_has_roots_and_children`
(renamed from `test_list_all_roots`, which asserted *every* returned org is a root) both drop
the exact-match/all-roots assumption — Tier 4 seeds actual parent-child organization structure
(Anchalika → Sakha, etc.), so "every org is a root" is no longer true and is no longer
asserted; instead the test only checks that at least 3 roots still exist among the (now larger,
mixed root+child) result set.

```python
def test_filter_by_status_code(self, client):
    """Filtering by status_code returns only matching organizations."""
    orgs = client.get(f"{BASE}/organizations").json()
    if not orgs:
        pytest.skip("No orgs seeded")
    status = orgs[0]["status_code"]
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/organizations", params={"status_code": status})
    assert r.status_code == 200
    for org in r.json():
        assert org["status_code"] == status
```

Previously hardcoded `params={"status_code": "ACTIVE"}` and asserted every result was
`"ACTIVE"`. Now picks whatever status the first seeded org actually has and filters by that —
still verifies the filter works, without assuming `"ACTIVE"` specifically is present or that
filtering by it yields any particular count.

Six tests that used to pin literal seeded contact-field values (`test_all_orgs_have_nss_youtube`,
`test_kendra_has_contact_info`, `test_smruti_mandira_has_contact_info`,
`test_all_orgs_have_nss_email`, `test_all_orgs_have_nss_website`) were similarly loosened —
each now either asserts "at least one org has a non-empty value for this field" instead of
"every org has this exact literal value," or adds a `pytest.skip(...)` guard for when the
specific seeded org type (Kendra, Smruti Mandira) isn't present, e.g.:

```python
def test_kendra_has_contact_info(self, client):
    """Kendra org has phone, mobile, and website populated."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/organizations", params={"type_code": "KENDRA"})
    data = r.json()
    if not data:
        pytest.skip("No KENDRA org seeded")
    kendra = data[0]
    assert kendra["phone_number"] is not None, "Kendra missing phone_number"
    assert kendra["mobile_number"] is not None, "Kendra missing mobile_number"
    assert kendra["website_url"] is not None, "Kendra missing website_url"
```

(Was: literal `assert kendra["phone_number"] == "+91-674-2390055"` etc., with no skip guard and
`r.json()[0]` accessed unconditionally.)

The pagination group (8 tests) exercises `limit`/`offset` query params added to
`/organizations`; only the "returns all seeded" test needed loosening (`== 3` → `>= 3`) since
pagination *behaviour* (offset skipping, limit bounds) doesn't depend on the exact seeded
count:

```python
def test_pagination_limit_and_offset(self, client):
    """limit=1 offset=1 returns the second organization."""
    all_data = client.get(f"{BASE}/organizations").json()
    if len(all_data) < 2:
        pytest.skip("Need at least 2 orgs for offset test")
    page = client.get(f"{BASE}/organizations", params={"limit": 1, "offset": 1}).json()
    assert len(page) == 1
    assert page[0]["organization_pk"] == all_data[1]["organization_pk"]


def test_pagination_limit_zero_returns_422(self, client):
    """limit=0 violates ge=1 constraint — returns 422."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/organizations", params={"limit": 0})
    assert r.status_code == 422


def test_pagination_limit_over_max_returns_422(self, client):
    """limit=501 exceeds MAX_LIMIT=500 — returns 422."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/organizations", params={"limit": 501})
    assert r.status_code == 422
```

`test_pagination_limit_and_offset` proves `offset` actually skips rows in a stable order (the
second page's single row matches the unpaginated list's second element), not just that the
response shrinks. `test_pagination_limit_zero_returns_422` and
`test_pagination_limit_over_max_returns_422` pin FastAPI/Pydantic's `Query(ge=1, le=500)`-style
constraints (shared `MAX_LIMIT=500` constant from `api/helpers.py`) at the boundary — 0 and 501
both fail validation before the router body ever runs.

| Test | Lines | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `test_list_returns_200` | 128–135 | `GET /organizations` → 200, non-empty |
| `test_list_includes_known_orgs` | 164–170 | `len >= 3`; at least 1 root present |
| `test_list_all_active` | 172–175 | Every org has `is_active is True` |
| `test_list_has_roots_and_children` | 177–181 | At least 3 roots (`parent_organization_pk is None`) |
| `test_filter_by_type_code` | 183–189 | `?type_code=KENDRA` → all results have matching type code |
| `test_filter_by_status_code` | 192–202 | `?status_code=<first org's status>` → every result has matching `status_code` (skips if no orgs) |
| `test_filter_nonexistent_type_returns_empty` | 203–207 | `?type_code=ZZZZZ_FAKE` → 200 with `[]` |
| `test_detail_valid_pk` | 209–216 | `GET /organizations/{pk}` → 200, returned `organization_pk` matches |
| `test_detail_fake_pk_returns_404` | 217–220 | All-zero UUID → 404 |
| `test_detail_bad_uuid_returns_422` | 221–224 | `"not-a-uuid"` → 422 |
| `test_detail_has_resolved_country` | 225–230 | Kendra org has `country_name is not None` (LEFT JOIN resolution works) |
| `test_detail_has_postal_code` | 231–236 | Kendra org has `postal_code is not None` |
| `test_contact_fields_nullable` | 237–248 | All 8 contact/online-presence keys present on every org |
| `test_smruti_mandira_has_contact_info` | 266–274 | Smruti Mandira (if seeded) has non-null `phone_number` |
| `test_all_orgs_have_nss_email` | 275–280 | At least 1 org has a non-empty `email` |
| `test_all_orgs_have_nss_website` | 281–288 | At least 1 org has a non-empty `website_url` |
| `test_pagination_default_returns_all_seeded` | 289–293 | No params → `len >= 3` |
| `test_pagination_limit_1` | 294–298 | `limit=1` → exactly 1 result |
| `test_pagination_offset_skips` | 299–304 | `offset=1` → one fewer result than the unpaginated list |
| `test_pagination_negative_offset_returns_422` | 324–328 | `offset=-1` violates `ge=0` — 422 |
| `test_pagination_large_offset_returns_empty` | 329–338 | `offset=9999` → 200 with `[]`, not an error |

The two resolved-geography tests (`test_detail_has_resolved_country`,
`test_detail_has_postal_code`) are unique to Organization — they verify that the 6 LEFT JOINs
in the organization SELECT actually resolve nullable geographic FK columns to non-NULL display
names for the Kendra seed record.

#### `TestOrganizationChildren` (lines 341–380, 4 tests)

| Test | Lines | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `test_children_returns_200` | 344–350 | Valid parent PK → 200, list |
| `test_children_empty_for_leaf_org` | 352–361 | A dynamically-found leaf org (no children) → `[]` |
| `test_children_fake_pk_returns_404` | 364–368 | All-zero UUID → 404 (parent existence check) |
| `test_children_bad_uuid_returns_422` | 370–380 | `"not-a-uuid"` → 422 |

`test_children_empty_for_leaf_org` changed shape for Tier 4: it used to assume `orgs[0]` (the
first seeded org, always a root with no children pre-Tier-4) was a valid leaf. Now that
Tier 4 seeds real parent-child structure, it instead computes `parent_pks = {every org's
parent_organization_pk}` and picks any org whose own `organization_pk` is *not* in that set —
i.e. an org nobody lists as their parent — skipping the test if none is found. The 404 test is
still critical: the `/organizations/{pk}/children` endpoint first checks that the parent
exists (a `SELECT` against `nss.organization`), and only then queries for children. Without
that guard, any UUID — valid or not — would return `200 []`, making it impossible to
distinguish "org exists but has no children" from "org doesn't exist."

#### `TestHierarchy` (lines 382–443, 9 tests)

```python
def test_hierarchy_has_required_fields(self, client):
    """Each hierarchy node has expected fields."""
    required = {
        "organization_pk", "organization_name", "organization_code",
        "organization_type_code", "organization_type_name",
        "status_code", "status_name",
        "parent_organization_pk", "depth", "is_active",
    }
    for node in client.get(f"{BASE}/hierarchy").json():
        assert required.issubset(node.keys()), (
            f"Missing fields in hierarchy node: {required - node.keys()}"
        )
```

Like `TestOrganizations`, the required-fields set uses `status_code`/`status_name` (not
`organization_status_code`/`organization_status_name`), reflecting the same master-data-backed
status field rename. Per `CLAUDE.md`, the underlying `WITH RECURSIVE` CTE also carries a depth
guard capped at 10 to prevent runaway recursion on a corrupted/cyclic parent chain.

**Resolved (foreshadowed in an earlier version of this doc):** that earlier version noted "With
only root organizations seeded, the recursive CTE's anchor member returns 3 rows at `depth = 0`
... When child organizations are seeded in future tiers, `test_hierarchy_roots_at_depth_0` will
need updating." Tier 4 is exactly that future tier — real child organizations are now seeded,
and both tests were updated accordingly:

```python
def test_hierarchy_roots_at_depth_0(self, client):
    """Root orgs are at depth 0 with no parent."""
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/hierarchy").json()
    roots = [n for n in data if n["depth"] == 0]
    assert len(roots) >= 1, "Expected at least 1 root at depth 0"
    for node in roots:
        assert node["parent_organization_pk"] is None


def test_hierarchy_returns_seeded_nodes(self, client):
    """Hierarchy has at least 3 nodes (minimum: KEN, NKT, SMR)."""
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/hierarchy").json()
    assert len(data) >= 3
```

`test_hierarchy_roots_at_depth_0` (renamed from a version that asserted *every* node has
`depth == 0`) now filters to only the depth-0 nodes and checks those have no parent — it no
longer assumes the whole hierarchy is flat. `test_hierarchy_returns_seeded_nodes` (renamed
from `test_hierarchy_returns_3_nodes`) drops the exact `== 3` in favour of `>= 3`.

The pagination group (5 tests) mirrors `TestOrganizations`'s pagination tests, applied to
`/hierarchy`:

```python
def test_hierarchy_pagination_offset(self, client):
    """Hierarchy with offset=1 skips first node."""
    all_data = client.get(f"{BASE}/hierarchy").json()
    offset_data = client.get(f"{BASE}/hierarchy", params={"offset": 1}).json()
    assert len(offset_data) == len(all_data) - 1
```

| Test | Lines | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `test_hierarchy_returns_200` | 385–392 | `GET /hierarchy` → 200, non-empty |
| `test_hierarchy_roots_at_depth_0` | 406–413 | Depth-0 nodes (if any) have `parent_organization_pk is None` |
| `test_hierarchy_returns_seeded_nodes` | 414–420 | `len >= 3` |
| `test_hierarchy_pagination_limit_1` | 421–425 | `limit=1` → exactly 1 node |
| `test_hierarchy_pagination_limit_zero_returns_422` | 432–436 | `limit=0` → 422 |
| `test_hierarchy_pagination_limit_over_max_returns_422` | 437–441 | `limit=501` → 422 |
| `test_hierarchy_pagination_negative_offset_returns_422` | 442–443 | `offset=-1` → 422 |

#### `TestOrganizationUI` (lines 453–531, 13 tests)

The Organization Verification UI page structure tests. Same pattern as `TestBootstrapUI`
and `TestFoundationUI` — testing that the HTML page served by the UI route includes
the expected structural elements:

| Test | Lines | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `test_organization_page_returns_200` | 456–461 | `GET /organization` → 200, `text/html` content type |
| `test_page_contains_title` | 462–466 | HTML contains "Organization Verification" |
| `test_page_contains_branding` | 467–471 | HTML contains "Nilachala Saraswata Sangha" |
| `test_page_loads_alpine_js` | 472–477 | HTML contains "alpinejs" and "integrity=" (SRI) |
| `test_page_loads_daisyui` | 478–483 | HTML contains "daisyui" and "integrity=" (SRI) |
| `test_page_loads_tailwind` | 484–488 | HTML contains "cdn.tailwindcss.com" |
| `test_page_loads_organization_js` | 489–493 | HTML contains "organization.js" |
| `test_page_has_alpine_data_binding` | 494–498 | HTML contains `x-data="organizationApp()"` |
| `test_page_has_nav_links` | 499–505 | HTML contains `href="/"`, `href="/foundation"`, `href="/organization"` (all 3 tiers) |
| `test_page_has_three_tabs` | 506–512 | HTML contains "Reference Data", "Organizations", "Hierarchy" |
| `test_page_has_system_status_section` | 513–517 | HTML contains "System Status" |
| `test_page_has_nss_logo` | 518–522 | HTML contains "nss-logo.png" |
| `test_page_has_copyright_footer` | 523–531 | HTML contains "2026" and "All rights reserved" |

Two tests are unique to Organization and absent from Bootstrap/Foundation:
`test_page_has_three_tabs` (verifying the 3-tab structure) and
`test_page_loads_organization_js` (verifying the tier-specific JS file). This class's
assertions are unaffected by the Tier 4 seed-data-count changes described above — it never
asserted on row counts, only static HTML structure.

#### `TestOrganizationSecurity` (lines 535–561, 3 tests)

Verifies the security middleware applies to Organization endpoints specifically — the
cross-tier `test_security.py` only tests Bootstrap/frontend routes:

| Test | Lines | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `test_org_api_has_security_headers` | 538–546 | `GET /types` → 200, has `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `camera=()` in `Permissions-Policy` |
| `test_org_api_has_cache_control_no_store` | 547–551 | `GET /organizations` has `Cache-Control: no-store` |
| `test_org_ui_no_cache_control_no_store` | 552–561 | `GET /organization` (UI page) does NOT have `Cache-Control: no-store` |

The third test (`test_org_ui_no_cache_control_no_store`) is a deliberate inversion: HTML
pages should be cacheable by the browser, so the middleware's `no-store` header — applied
only to `/api/` paths — must **not** appear on the UI route. This confirms the path-based
conditional in `middleware.py` works correctly for Organization routes.

#### `TestChildrenStats` (lines 564–663, 8 tests)

New in Tier 4, on top of Family + Membership. Exercises
`GET /organizations/{organization_pk}/children-stats` (§2.9/§2.10 in
`API_CODE_EXPLANATIONS.md`) — the multi-CTE aggregate endpoint that recursively rolls up
family/member/person counts from every descendant Sakha up to each direct child, using the
FAM-036 majority-rule "effective Sakha" computation.

```python
def _get_kendra_pk(client):
    """Find the Kendra organization PK."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/organizations?type_code=KENDRA")
    data = r.json()
    return data[0]["organization_pk"] if data else None


class TestChildrenStats:
    """GET /api/v1/organization/organizations/{pk}/children-stats"""

    def test_children_stats_returns_200(self, client):
        """Children stats endpoint returns 200 for a valid parent."""
        pk = _get_kendra_pk(client)
        if pk is None:
            pytest.skip("No Kendra organization seeded")
        r = client.get(f"{BASE}/organizations/{pk}/children-stats")
        assert r.status_code == 200
        assert isinstance(r.json(), list)
```

`_get_kendra_pk` is a module-level helper (not a fixture) that looks up the seeded Kendra —
every test in the class uses it as the "known org with real Sakha descendants" starting point,
`pytest.skip`ping if Kendra isn't seeded rather than failing, consistent with the rest of the
file's Tier-4-seed-tolerant style.

| Test | Lines | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `test_children_stats_returns_200` | 574–581 | Valid Kendra PK → 200, list (skips if no Kendra) |
| `test_children_stats_fake_pk_returns_404` | 583–586 | All-zero UUID → 404 (parent existence check) |
| `test_children_stats_has_required_fields` | 588–604 | Each entry has `organization_pk/name/code/type_code`, `family_count`, `member_count`, `person_count` |
| `test_children_stats_counts_are_non_negative` | 606–614 | Every count is `>= 0` |
| `test_children_stats_kendra_has_families` | 616–623 | Sum of `family_count` across Kendra's children is `>= 1` |
| `test_children_stats_members_lte_persons` | 625–634 | For every entry, `member_count <= person_count` (not every family member holds a Sangha Sevi membership) |
| `test_children_stats_sakha_level` | 636–653 | Drilling one level down (Kendra's first child) still returns valid `SAKHA_SANGHA`-typed entries with the same required fields |
| `test_children_stats_leaf_org_returns_empty` | 655–663 | A Sakha (leaf org, no children) → `200 []` |

`test_children_stats_members_lte_persons` is the test that most directly exercises the
FAM-036/affiliation distinction documented in `API_CODE_EXPLANATIONS.md` §2.9: `person_count`
is every current family member under the effective Sakha, while `member_count` is only those
with an active Sangha Sevi affiliation — the invariant holds because membership is a subset of
family membership, not because of any explicit `LIMIT` or filter tying the two together. No
test in this class directly exercises the FAM-036 majority computation itself (e.g. seeding a
family with a majority-Sakha different from its stored `sakha_organization_pk` and asserting
the count lands on the majority Sakha) — coverage here is limited to shape/non-negativity/
the member≤person invariant, not the majority-rule arithmetic itself.

### 2.6 `tests/test_person.py`

**Requirement**

The 4 Tier 3 Person endpoints span 2 tables (`person`, `person_address`) and introduce the
first data-sensitivity-driven test class in the suite: Aadhaar is a government identifier that
must never leave the API in raw form, so every list/detail/search response needs a regression
guard proving `aadhaar_encrypted` and `aadhaar_hash` are absent, and that only `aadhaar_last4`
(and only on the detail endpoint, never the summary shapes) is ever returned. Unlike
Organization, `person`/`person_address` have **no seed data** — the DDL bootstraps the schema
but seeds nothing — so most tests are written defensively (`pytest.skip("No person data
seeded")` or asserting on empty lists) rather than pinning literal counts, and the file's real
job is proving endpoint *structure*, *filter wiring*, *error handling*, *trigram search*, and
*security* hold even with zero rows. This file is the executable specification for the entire
Tier 3 Person API contract, its aadhaar-masking guarantee, and UI structure tests for the
Person Verification UI page. **56 tests across 6 classes.**

**Line-by-line**

```python
"""
NSS ERP — Tier 3 Person API tests.

Integration tests for the 4 Person GET endpoints across 2 tables.
Runs against local PostgreSQL (not Neon). The database must be
bootstrapped with DDL + seed before running.

Person tables have no seed data — the test suite verifies endpoint
structure, response shapes, error handling, security, and UI rendering.
Data-dependent assertions (field values, counts) are guarded by
availability.

Endpoint groups tested:
  1. Person List:     /persons (with filters)
  2. Person Detail:   /persons/{person_pk}
  3. Addresses:       /persons/{person_pk}/addresses
  4. Search:          /search?q=
  5. Security:        aadhaar exclusion, security headers
  6. UI Route:        /person serves HTML

import pytest


pytestmark = pytest.mark.integration

BASE = "/api/v1/person"
FAKE_UUID = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

Module docstring states "4 Person GET endpoints across 2 tables," explicitly documents that
Person tables "have no seed data" and that "data-dependent assertions... are guarded by
availability," and lists the six test groups. `pytestmark`, `BASE`, and `FAKE_UUID` follow the
same pattern as `test_organization.py`.

```python
def _get_first_person_pk(client):
    """Return the PK of the first person, or None if no data."""
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/persons").json()
    return data[0]["person_pk"] if data else None
```

A module-level helper (lines 36–39), not a fixture — every detail/address/search test that
needs a real `person_pk` calls this first and, if it returns `None` (no seed data present),
calls `pytest.skip(...)` rather than failing; this is the mechanism that lets the whole file
pass cleanly against an empty `person` table while still exercising real-data code paths
whenever data *is* present (e.g. after Tier 4 membership onboarding seeds real people).

#### `TestPersonList` (lines 47–174, 17 tests)

```python
def test_list_excludes_sensitive_aadhaar(self, client):
    """Summary list must not contain aadhaar_encrypted or aadhaar_hash."""
    for p in client.get(f"{BASE}/persons").json():
        assert "aadhaar_encrypted" not in p
        assert "aadhaar_hash" not in p
        # Summary also excludes aadhaar_last4
        assert "aadhaar_last4" not in p
```

The list endpoint uses `PersonSummaryResponse` (a narrower shape than the detail endpoint's
`PersonResponse`), so this test asserts all three Aadhaar-related keys are absent — not just
the two raw/sensitive ones, but also the masked `aadhaar_last4`, which is reserved for the
detail view only. `test_list_excludes_audit_columns` (lines 80–92) runs the parallel check for
the six audit columns (`created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`, and the three
`*_by_sangha_sevi_pk` actor columns), which per `CLAUDE.md`'s "Pass 2 audit-actor FK
constraints" deferral don't yet have FK constraints but must still never leak through the API.

```python
def test_list_has_required_fields_if_data(self, client):
    """Each person summary has the expected response fields."""
    required = {
        "person_pk", "person_id",
        "first_name", "middle_name", "last_name",
        "date_of_birth", "date_of_death",
        "gender_code", "gender_name",
        "marital_status_code", "marital_status_name",
        "blood_group_code", "blood_group_name",
        "country_phone_code", "mobile_number", "email",
        "is_active",
    }
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/persons").json()
    for p in data:
        assert required.issubset(p.keys()), (
            f"Missing fields in person {p.get('person_id', '?')}: "
            f"{required - p.keys()}"
        )
```

The `_if_data` suffix (also used by `TestPersonAddresses.test_addresses_has_required_fields_if_data`)
is this file's naming convention for "loop runs zero times and trivially passes if the table is
empty" — the `for p in data:` loop body simply never executes against an empty list, so the
test is always green regardless of seed state, while still asserting the full shape whenever
rows exist. The required set proves gender/marital-status/blood-group master-data FKs are
resolved via JOIN to their `_code`/`_name` pairs, matching `CLAUDE.md`'s "Master-data FKs...
are resolved via JOINs" note for Tier 3.

Three filter tests exercise the master-data-driven query params:

```python
def test_filter_by_gender_code_returns_200(self, client):
    """Filtering by gender_code returns 200."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/persons", params={"gender_code": "MALE"})
    assert r.status_code == 200
    assert isinstance(r.json(), list)
    for p in r.json():
        assert p["gender_code"] == "MALE"
```

`test_filter_by_gender_code_returns_200` asserts **every** returned row's `gender_code`
actually matches (not just that the call succeeded), the same rigor as Foundation's filter
tests; `test_filter_by_marital_status_code_returns_200` and
`test_filter_by_blood_group_code_returns_200` only assert 200 + list type (no seeded rows to
spot-check against), and `test_filter_nonexistent_gender_returns_empty` confirms a fabricated
code returns `200 []`, not a 404 — the same "zero matches is a successful empty result"
convention used throughout the API. `test_multiple_filters_returns_200` combines all three
filters in one request to prove they compose (`AND`-combined `WHERE` clauses) without error.

The pagination group (7 tests) mirrors `TestOrganizations`'s pagination tests:

```python
def test_pagination_limit_zero_returns_422(self, client):
    """limit=0 violates ge=1 constraint — returns 422."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/persons", params={"limit": 0})
    assert r.status_code == 422


def test_pagination_max_limit_accepted(self, client):
    """limit=500 (MAX_LIMIT) is accepted."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/persons", params={"limit": 500})
    assert r.status_code == 200
```

`test_pagination_max_limit_accepted` is new relative to the equivalent Organization/Hierarchy
pagination groups — it positively confirms the upper boundary (`limit=500`, the shared
`MAX_LIMIT` from `api/helpers.py`) is accepted, complementing
`test_pagination_limit_over_max_returns_422`'s check that `501` is rejected; together the two
tests pin the exact boundary rather than just one side of it.

| Test | Lines | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `test_list_returns_200` | 50–54 | `GET /persons` → 200, list |
| `test_list_all_active` | 75–78 | Every returned person has `is_active is True` |
| `test_pagination_default_returns_200` | 140–143 | No params → 200 |
| `test_pagination_custom_limit` | 145–148 | `limit=1` → at most 1 result |
| `test_pagination_limit_over_max_returns_422` | 155–158 | `limit=501` → 422 |
| `test_pagination_negative_offset_returns_422` | 160–163 | `offset=-1` → 422 |
| `test_pagination_large_offset_returns_empty` | 165–169 | `offset=9999` → 200 with `[]` |

#### `TestPersonDetail` (lines 182–255, 6 tests)

```python
def test_detail_has_required_fields(self, client):
    """Full detail response has all PersonResponse fields."""
    pk = _get_first_person_pk(client)
    if pk is None:
        pytest.skip("No person data seeded")
    required = {
        "person_pk", "person_id",
        "first_name", "middle_name", "last_name",
        "date_of_birth", "date_of_death",
        "gender_master_data_pk", "gender_code", "gender_name",
        "marital_status_master_data_pk", "marital_status_code",
        "marital_status_name",
        "blood_group_master_data_pk", "blood_group_code",
        "blood_group_name",
        "country_phone_code", "mobile_number", "email",
        "aadhaar_last4",
        "photo_document_master_pk",
        "emergency_contact_name", "emergency_contact_phone",
        "emergency_relationship_master_data_pk",
        "emergency_relationship_code", "emergency_relationship_name",
        "remarks", "is_active",
    }
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/persons/{pk}").json()
    assert required.issubset(data.keys()), (
        f"Missing fields: {required - data.keys()}"
    )
```

This is the one place `aadhaar_last4` is expected to be *present* — the detail response's
required set explicitly includes it, in direct contrast to `TestPersonList` and
`TestPersonSearch`, which both assert its *absence*. The set also includes the raw
`*_master_data_pk` FK columns alongside their resolved `_code`/`_name` pairs (e.g.
`gender_master_data_pk` + `gender_code` + `gender_name`), and the full emergency-contact block
(`emergency_contact_name`, `emergency_contact_phone`,
`emergency_relationship_master_data_pk`/`_code`/`_name`) that the summary shape omits entirely.
Every test in this class calls `_get_first_person_pk(client)` first and skips via
`pytest.skip("No person data seeded")` if it returns `None`.

```python
def test_detail_excludes_sensitive_aadhaar(self, client):
    """Detail response must never contain raw Aadhaar fields."""
    pk = _get_first_person_pk(client)
    if pk is None:
        pytest.skip("No person data seeded")
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/persons/{pk}").json()
    assert "aadhaar_encrypted" not in data
    assert "aadhaar_hash" not in data
```

Even on the detail endpoint — which does expose the masked `aadhaar_last4` — the two raw
columns (`aadhaar_encrypted`, the ciphertext; `aadhaar_hash`, used for uniqueness lookups) must
never appear. This is the single most important regression guard in the file given
`CLAUDE.md`'s explicit statement that these columns are "never" returned.

| Test | Lines | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `test_detail_fake_pk_returns_404` | 185–188 | All-zero UUID → 404 |
| `test_detail_bad_uuid_returns_422` | 190–193 | `"not-a-uuid"` → 422 |
| `test_detail_valid_pk_returns_200` | 195–203 | Valid PK → 200, returned `person_pk` matches (skipped if no data) |
| `test_detail_excludes_audit_columns` | 241–255 | Same 6-column audit check as the list endpoint (skipped if no data) |

#### `TestPersonAddresses` (lines 263–323, 5 tests)

```python
def test_addresses_has_required_fields_if_data(self, client):
    """Each address has the expected response fields."""
    pk = _get_first_person_pk(client)
    if pk is None:
        pytest.skip("No person data seeded")
    required = {
        "person_address_pk", "person_pk",
        "address_type_master_data_pk", "address_type_code",
        "address_type_name",
        "address_line_1", "address_line_2", "landmark",
        "city_village_postal_code_map_pk",
        "city_village_name", "postal_code",
        "district_name", "state_name", "country_name",
        "is_primary", "remarks", "is_active",
    }
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/persons/{pk}/addresses").json()
    for addr in data:
        assert required.issubset(addr.keys()), (
            f"Missing fields in address: {required - addr.keys()}"
        )
```

Proves address rows carry resolved `address_type` (via `address_type_master_data_pk`) and
resolved geography (`city_village_name`, `postal_code`, `district_name`, `state_name`,
`country_name`) inline, chained from `city_village_postal_code_map_pk` through Foundation's
geography tables the same way Organization's list resolves its own address fields.

```python
def test_addresses_primary_first(self, client):
    """Primary addresses are ordered before non-primary."""
    pk = _get_first_person_pk(client)
    if pk is None:
        pytest.skip("No person data seeded")
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/persons/{pk}/addresses").json()
    if len(data) >= 2:
        primaries = [a for a in data if a["is_primary"]]
        non_primaries = [a for a in data if not a["is_primary"]]
        if primaries and non_primaries:
            first_non_primary_idx = next(
                i for i, a in enumerate(data) if not a["is_primary"]
            )
            last_primary_idx = max(
                i for i, a in enumerate(data) if a["is_primary"]
            )
            assert last_primary_idx < first_non_primary_idx
```

A triple-guarded ordering test: skips entirely with no person data, is a no-op with fewer than
2 addresses, and only asserts the ordering invariant (every primary address index precedes
every non-primary index) when both kinds are actually present — proving the endpoint's
`ORDER BY is_primary DESC, ...` (or equivalent) without requiring specific seed data to exist.

| Test | Lines | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `test_addresses_fake_pk_returns_404` | 266–269 | All-zero UUID → 404 (parent person existence check) |
| `test_addresses_bad_uuid_returns_422` | 271–274 | `"not-a-uuid"` → 422 |
| `test_addresses_valid_pk_returns_200` | 276–283 | Valid person PK → 200, list (possibly empty; skipped if no data) |

#### `TestPersonSearch` (lines 331–389, 8 tests)

```python
def test_search_min_length_validation(self, client):
    """Search with single character returns 422 (min_length=2)."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/search", params={"q": "a"})
    assert r.status_code == 422


def test_search_two_chars_accepted(self, client):
    """Search with exactly 2 characters returns 200."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/search", params={"q": "ab"})
    assert r.status_code == 200
```

Pins the exact boundary of the `q: str = Query(..., min_length=2)` constraint backing the
trigram search — 1 character rejected, 2 accepted — the same boundary-pinning style used for
`limit`/`offset` elsewhere in the suite. `test_search_requires_query` (lines 340–343) confirms
omitting `q` entirely is also a 422 (FastAPI's required-query-param validation, no custom code
involved).

```python
def test_search_returns_summary_fields(self, client):
    """Search results use PersonSummaryResponse shape."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/search", params={"q": "test"})
    for p in r.json():
        assert "person_pk" in p
        assert "person_id" in p
        assert "first_name" in p
        assert "is_active" in p
        # Summary: no aadhaar, no emergency
        assert "aadhaar_encrypted" not in p
        assert "aadhaar_hash" not in p
        assert "aadhaar_last4" not in p
```

Confirms `/search` returns the same narrow `PersonSummaryResponse` shape as `/persons` — not
the full detail shape — including the same three-way Aadhaar exclusion (`aadhaar_last4`
included) as `TestPersonList.test_list_excludes_sensitive_aadhaar`.
`test_search_excludes_audit_columns` (lines 368–377) runs the matching audit-column check.
`test_search_max_50_results` (lines 385–389) asserts `len(r.json()) <= 50`, pinning the
search endpoint's result cap (distinct from the `limit`/`offset` pagination used by `/persons`
— search has no `offset`, just a hard cap).

| Test | Lines | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `test_search_returns_200` | 334–338 | `?q=test` → 200, list |
| `test_search_nonexistent_returns_empty` | 379–383 | `?q=zzzxxyynomatch` → 200 with `[]` |

#### `TestPersonSecurity` (lines 397–429, 5 tests)

```python
def test_person_api_has_security_headers(self, client):
    """Person API responses include the four core security headers."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/persons")
    assert r.status_code == 200
    assert r.headers["X-Content-Type-Options"] == "nosniff"
    assert r.headers["X-Frame-Options"] == "DENY"
    assert r.headers["Referrer-Policy"] == "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    assert "camera=()" in r.headers["Permissions-Policy"]


def test_404_has_security_headers(self, client):
    """Even 404 responses get security headers."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/persons/{FAKE_UUID}")
    assert r.status_code == 404
    assert r.headers["X-Content-Type-Options"] == "nosniff"
```

Same four-header pattern as `TestOrganizationSecurity`, plus two tests unique to this class:
`test_search_has_security_headers` (lines 420–423), confirming the headers apply to `/search`
specifically, and `test_404_has_security_headers` — proving the security middleware runs even
on error responses, i.e. it wraps the whole ASGI call chain rather than only successful
handler returns.

| Test | Lines | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `test_person_api_has_cache_control_no_store` | 409–412 | `GET /persons` has `Cache-Control: no-store` |
| `test_person_ui_no_cache_control_no_store` | 414–418 | `GET /person` (UI page) does NOT have `Cache-Control: no-store` |

#### `TestPersonUI` (lines 437–521, 15 tests)

The Person Verification UI page structure tests, following the same pattern as
`TestOrganizationUI`, plus two tests unique to Person's data-sensitivity requirements:

```python
def test_page_has_aadhaar_masking(self, client):
    """Page template contains the Aadhaar masking pattern."""
    html = client.get("/person").text
    assert "XXXX XXXX" in html


def test_page_has_search_input(self, client):
    """Page contains a search input for trigram search."""
    html = client.get("/person").text
    assert "trigram" in html.lower()
```

`test_page_has_aadhaar_masking` proves the frontend template itself contains the `XXXX XXXX`
masking pattern used to display Aadhaar values (defense in depth alongside the API-layer
exclusion tests), and `test_page_has_search_input` confirms the page documents its search box
as trigram-backed. `test_page_has_nav_links` (lines 483–489) checks all **four** tier nav links
(`/`, `/foundation`, `/organization`, `/person`) — one more than Organization's three, since
Person is the newest tier. `test_page_has_two_tabs` (lines 491–495) checks for "Persons" and
"Search" (Person's UI has 2 tabs, vs. Organization's 3).

| Test | Lines | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `test_person_page_returns_200` | 440–444 | `GET /person` → 200, `text/html` content type |
| `test_page_contains_title` | 446–449 | HTML contains "Person Verification" |
| `test_page_contains_branding` | 451–454 | HTML contains "Nilachala Saraswata Sangha" |
| `test_page_loads_alpine_js` | 456–460 | HTML contains "alpinejs" and "integrity=" (SRI) |
| `test_page_loads_daisyui` | 462–466 | HTML contains "daisyui" and "integrity=" (SRI) |
| `test_page_loads_tailwind` | 468–471 | HTML contains "cdn.tailwindcss.com" |
| `test_page_loads_person_js` | 473–476 | HTML contains "person.js" |
| `test_page_has_alpine_data_binding` | 478–481 | HTML contains `x-data="personApp()"` |
| `test_page_has_system_status_section` | 497–500 | HTML contains "System Status" |
| `test_page_has_nss_logo` | 502–505 | HTML contains "nss-logo.png" |
| `test_page_has_copyright_footer` | 507–511 | HTML contains "2026" and "All rights reserved" |

### 2.7 `tests/test_family.py`

**Requirement**

The Tier 4 Family module now has 7 read-only endpoints across 3 tables (`family_group`,
`family_relationship`, `family_head_history`) plus the `family_link` graph and cross-module
`sangha_sevi`/`membership_sakha_affiliation`/`parichaya_patra`/`anumati_patra` lookups the three
newer endpoints (`/graph`, `/sakha-alignment`, `/person/{pk}/membership-summary`) join against.
This file was rewritten from a literal-seed-value style (one family, "Mishra Paribara," with 3
current members and 1 head-history record — see `database/seed/04_family/README.md`) to be
**fully dynamic**: the module docstring now states tests "discover families, members, and status
codes from the live API. No hardcoded family IDs, org codes, or status values." It is still
guarded with `pytest.skip("No family data seeded")` wherever a test needs a real
`family_group_pk`, so the suite stays green against a database bootstrapped without the Tier 4
verification seed. This file is the executable specification for the Family API contract, its
`is_current`/`is_active` filtering behaviour, and the Family Verification UI's structure.
**67 tests across 8 classes** (up from 51 across 6): the original six classes are all still
present but loosened to discover-then-assert instead of hardcode-then-assert, plus two wholly
new classes, `TestOrgAdminFamilyFilter` and `TestSakhaAlignment`.

**Line-by-line**

```python
"""
NSS ERP — Tier 4 Family API tests.

import pytest


pytestmark = pytest.mark.integration

BASE = "/api/v1/family"
FAKE_UUID = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

Module docstring still says "4 Family GET endpoints across 3 tables" and lists only the original
six test groups — stale now that the file also covers `TestOrgAdminFamilyFilter` and
`TestSakhaAlignment`, but the docstring's real, load-bearing change is the seed-data paragraph:
the previous version's literal roster (P1 Ramesh HEAD, P2 Priyanka WIFE, P4 Debasis SON — itself
already flagged in an earlier pass of this doc as not matching the actual seed file's P1 Ramesh
FATHER/P2 Sushma SPOUSE/P3 Aniket SON) has been deleted outright and replaced with the
"fully dynamic ... no hardcoded family IDs" statement above, matching what the test bodies below
now actually do. `pytestmark`, `BASE`, `FAKE_UUID` are unchanged.

```python

    """Return the PK of the first family, or None if no data."""
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/families").json()

```

A module-level helper, same `_get_first_*_pk` pattern as `test_person.py`'s
`_get_first_person_pk` and `test_organization.py`'s equivalent — every detail/members/head-history
test calls this first and skips if it returns `None`.

#### `TestFamilyList` (lines 46–184, 17 tests)

    assert f["status_code"] is not None and len(f["status_code"]) > 0
```

Was a literal-value test (`mishra = [f for f in data if f["family_id"] == "F1"]` then
`assert f["family_name"] == "Mishra"` / `assert f["status_code"] == "ACTIVE"`); now discovers the
first returned family and asserts only that its name/status are non-empty strings — no longer
coupled to any specific seed row. `test_filter_by_sakha_code`/`test_filter_by_status_code`/
`test_multiple_filters` follow the same discover-then-assert shift: each now calls
`GET /families` first to read a real `sakha_code`/`status_code` off the live data, then filters
by that discovered value and asserts every returned row matches it — replacing the previous
version's hardcoded `"SKH1"`/`"ACTIVE"` literals, which would silently pass or return an
unexpectedly empty list against a database seeded with different codes rather than actually
proving the filter logic. The remaining 10 tests are the standard pagination contract suite
(`limit=0` → 422, `limit=501` → 422, `offset=-1` → 422, `limit=500` accepted, over-range offset
→ empty list not error) — unchanged from the previous revision, byte-for-byte the same pattern
`test_person.py`'s `TestPersonList` and `test_organization.py`'s equivalent already establish
for every paginated list endpoint in the API.

#### `TestFamilyDetail` (lines 187–246, 5 tests)

```python
def test_detail_fake_pk_returns_404(self, client):
    """Fetching a nonexistent family returns 404."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/families/{FAKE_UUID}")
    assert r.status_code == 404
```

Unchanged from the previous revision: the standard fake-UUID-404 / malformed-UUID-422 /
valid-PK-200 / required-fields / audit-column-exclusion quintet used by every detail endpoint's
test class across the suite.

#### `TestFamilyMembers` (lines 248–335, 8 tests)

```python
def test_members_seeded_count(self, client):
    """First family has at least 1 member."""
    pk = _get_first_family_pk(client)
    if pk is None:
        pytest.skip("No family data seeded")
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/families/{pk}/members").json()
    assert len(data) >= 1, f"Expected at least 1 member, got {len(data)}"
```

```python
def test_members_has_head_relationship(self, client):
    """F1 Mishra has exactly one current head (via is_head flag)."""
    pk = _get_first_family_pk(client)
    if pk is None:
        pytest.skip("No family data seeded")
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/families/{pk}/members").json()
    heads = [m for m in data if m["is_head"] is True]
    assert len(heads) == 1, "Expected exactly 1 HEAD"
```

`test_members_seeded_count` loosened from an exact `== 3` to `>= 1`. `test_members_has_head_
relationship` is the more significant fix: an earlier version of this file (and an earlier
version of this doc) filtered on `m["relationship_type_code"] == "HEAD"` — a filter flagged as
mismatched against the real seed data (which uses `FATHER`, not `HEAD`, for the head's
relationship type) and therefore likely to find zero rows and fail `assert len(heads) == 1`. It
now filters on the `is_head` boolean flag instead — a value the router derives server-side from a
`family_head_history` join (`api/routers/family.py`'s `_MEMBER_SELECT`, `CASE WHEN
fhh.family_head_history_pk IS NOT NULL THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END AS is_head`), independent of
whatever `relationship_type_code` the head happens to carry. This is the correct,
seed-data-agnostic way to find the current head, and resolves the mismatch flagged in the
previous revision of this document. `test_members_fake_pk_returns_404`/
`test_members_bad_uuid_returns_422` verify the endpoint's "verify parent exists, then fetch
children" 404 behaviour (see `API_CODE_EXPLANATIONS.md` §2.13), and `test_members_all_current`
asserts every returned row has `is_current: true` — proving the router's
`WHERE fr.is_current = TRUE` filter is actually applied, not just documented.

#### `TestFamilyHeadHistory` (lines 337–410, 7 tests)

```python
def test_head_history_current_head_has_no_end_date(self, client):
    """Current head should have effective_to=None."""
    pk = _get_first_family_pk(client)
    if pk is None:
        pytest.skip("No family data seeded")
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/families/{pk}/head-history").json()
    current = [h for h in data if h["effective_to"] is None]
    assert len(current) >= 1, "Expected at least 1 current head"
```

Unchanged from the previous revision: the one test that directly exercises the "current head is
the row with `effective_to IS NULL`" convention documented in `API_CODE_EXPLANATIONS.md` §2.13
and enforced at the DDL level by `uq_family_head_current` (a partial unique index guaranteeing
**at most** one such row per family) — this test only checks **at least** one, which is the
correct client-observable half of that guarantee (the uniqueness half is a database-level
invariant, not something an API integration test needs to re-verify). The remaining 6 tests are
the same 404/422/200/required-fields/seeded-count/audit-exclusion pattern as every other
sub-resource list endpoint in the suite.

#### `TestFamilySecurity` (lines 413–446, 4 tests)

```python
def test_family_ui_no_cache_control_no_store(self, client):
    """Family UI page does NOT have Cache-Control: no-store."""
    r = client.get("/family")
    assert r.status_code == 200
    assert r.headers.get("Cache-Control") != "no-store"
```

Unchanged from the previous revision: the same cross-tier security contract verified for every
other module in `test_security.py` and re-verified per-module here: `/api/v1/family/*` responses
carry the four core security headers and `Cache-Control: no-store`, while the `/family` UI page
itself does *not* get `no-store` (HTML pages are cacheable; API JSON responses are not) — and
even a 404 response still carries the security headers, proving `add_security_headers` runs
regardless of the eventual status code.

#### `TestFamilyUI` (lines 448–527, 13 tests, up from 10)

```python
def test_page_has_nav_links(self, client):
    """Page navigation includes links to tier UIs."""
    html = client.get("/family").text
    assert 'href="/"' in html
    assert 'href="/family"' in html
    assert 'href="/membership"' in html
```

The standard UI-structure smoke-test suite (title, branding, Alpine.js/DaisyUI CDN references,
`family.js` script tag, `x-data="familyApp()"` binding, nav links, NSS logo, copyright footer) —
identical in shape to `TestPersonUI`/`TestOrganizationUI`, just re-pointed at `/family` and
`familyApp()`. `test_page_has_copyright_footer`'s assertion changed from `"All rights reserved" in
html` to `"Nilachala Saraswata Sangha" in html` — the rebuilt `family.html` footer text itself
changed (§UI_CODE_EXPLANATIONS §2.12: now just `&copy; 2026 Nilachala Saraswata Sangha`, no "All
rights reserved" suffix), so the previous literal-string assertion would otherwise fail against
the current markup regardless of test logic, independent of any seed-data concern.

Three new tests cover the org-hierarchy drill-down view added alongside the three new Family
endpoints (§UI_CODE_EXPLANATIONS §2.12–§2.13): `test_page_has_view_mode_toggle` asserts the "My
Family"/"Org View" toggle buttons and `switchViewMode` are present; `test_page_has_org_breadcrumb`
asserts `orgBreadcrumb`/`breadcrumbNav`; `test_page_has_org_children_list` asserts
`orgChildren`/`drillIntoOrg` — the same "assert a known identifier string appears in the raw
HTML" smoke-test pattern every other UI test in the suite uses, not exercising any actual
navigation behaviour.

---

#### `TestOrgAdminFamilyFilter` (lines 529–609, 4 tests) — new

Verifies the org admin view's `sakha_code` family filtering end to end, spanning both the Family
and Organization APIs. `test_families_filter_by_sakha_code` discovers every `SAKHA_SANGHA`-type
org code via `GET /api/v1/organization/organizations?type_code=SAKHA_SANGHA`, then for each one
asserts `GET /families?sakha_code={code}` returns only families with that exact `sakha_code`.
`test_families_filter_unknown_sakha_returns_empty` asserts an unrecognized `sakha_code` returns
`200` with `[]`, not a `404` — the same "a filter value that matches nothing is still a valid,
empty result" contract every other filtered list endpoint in the API follows.
`test_org_hierarchy_kendra_has_children`/`test_org_drill_down_to_sakha` are structural checks that
walk Kendra → Anchalika/Zilla → children via `GET /api/v1/organization/organizations/{pk}/children`
and assert the drill-down eventually reaches Sakha-type nodes or at least produces further
children. This class exercises Organization's own `/children` endpoint from the Family test file
deliberately — it is testing *this page's* org-drill-down feature end to end, not duplicating
Organization's own test coverage of that endpoint.

#### `TestSakhaAlignment` (lines 612–708, 9 tests) — new

Covers `GET /families/{pk}/sakha-alignment` (FAM-036 majority rule). `test_alignment_returns_200`/
`test_alignment_fake_pk_returns_404` are the standard happy-path/404 pair.
`test_alignment_has_required_fields` asserts the full response shape (`family_group_pk`,
`family_name`, `assigned_sakha_pk`/`_name`/`_code`, `is_aligned`, `total_members`,
`members_with_affiliation`, `affiliations`, `members`). `test_alignment_members_list` asserts
`len(members) == total_members`; `test_alignment_affiliations_sum` asserts the per-Sakha
`affiliations[].member_count` values sum to `members_with_affiliation` — both are internal
consistency checks on the router's own aggregation logic (`api/routers/family.py`
`get_family_sakha_alignment`), not just response-shape checks. `test_alignment_is_always_aligned`
iterates every family and asserts `is_aligned is True` for all of them, with a docstring
explaining why this isn't a tautological test despite always passing ("family auto-follows
majority (FAM-036)") — `assigned_sakha_pk` in this response *is* the dynamically-computed
majority Sakha, so `is_aligned` is definitionally `True`; the test's real value is as a
regression guard (it would only go red if a future change decoupled `assigned_sakha_pk` from the
majority computation without keeping `is_aligned` in sync). `test_alignment_home_sakha_flag` is
the one test that cross-checks per-member `is_home_sakha` computation directly: for each member
with an affiliation it asserts `is_home_sakha == (affiliated_sakha_pk == assigned_sakha_pk)`.
`test_alignment_member_fields` checks each member entry carries
`person_pk`/`person_id`/`first_name`/`has_membership`. `test_ui_has_sakha_alignment_markup` is a
UI smoke test asserting `family.html` calls `isMemberSakhaMismatch`/`getMemberSakhaName`
(§UI_CODE_EXPLANATIONS §2.13) — this file's one direct link between the API-level alignment tests
above and the UI code that renders the per-member mismatch warnings.

**Known test gap:** neither `/families/{pk}/graph` (dynamic per-viewer relationship computation
via BFS over `family_link`, `api/services/family_graph.py`) nor
`/person/{pk}/membership-summary` has any test coverage in this file — unlike `/sakha-alignment`,
there is no `TestFamilyGraph`- or `TestMembershipSummary`-equivalent class. Neither the graph's
BFS traversal/`PATH_LABELS` lookup (male/female label selection by `gender_code`, generation-
offset computation, the `max_depth=6` cap, the "family exists but has no `family_link` rows →
`[]`" branch) nor the membership-summary endpoint's `sangha_sevi` lookup, its Parichaya/Anumati
Patra sub-fetches, or its `membership_type_code != "ASSOCIATE"` Anumati-Patra gate (MBR-019A/B)
is exercised by any integration test as of this revision.

### 2.8 `tests/test_membership.py`

**Requirement**

The 7 Tier 4 Membership endpoints span 5 tables (`sangha_sevi`, `membership_sakha_affiliation`,
`parichaya_patra`, `anumati_patra`, `membership_journey_event`) and are the executable
specification for the module's central non-obvious concept: the **three-tier identity model**
(Sangha Sevi ID / Local Sakha ERP Number / Kendra Number). Unlike Person, Membership *does* have
real seed data (5 members — see `database/seed/05_membership/README.md`), so most tests pin
literal seeded values (`SS1` is Regular, `SS3` was transferred, etc.) rather than defensively
skipping on empty tables — the file's job is proving the three-tier identity resolves correctly
across every endpoint, that trigram/prefix search covers all three tiers plus name/mobile/email,
and that the transfer/Kumari-transition/Associate-has-no-Anumati-Patra business rules encoded in
the seed data are actually visible through the API. **99 tests across 9 classes** — the largest
test file in the repository.

**Line-by-line**

```python
"""
NSS ERP — Tier 4 Membership API tests.

Integration tests for the 7 Membership GET endpoints across 5 tables.
Runs against local PostgreSQL (not Neon). The database must be
bootstrapped with DDL + seed before running.

Seed data: 5 members (SS1 Ramesh Regular, SS2 Aniket Probationary,
SS3 Suresh Transferred Regular, SS4 Debasis Associate, SS5 Smita
Kumari-transition Regular). Historical Anumati Patras for SS1/SS3.
Transfer: SS3 SKH1→SKH2.

Three-tier identity model:

"""

import pytest


pytestmark = pytest.mark.integration

BASE = "/api/v1/membership"
FAKE_UUID = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

The module docstring states "7 Membership GET endpoints across 5 tables," summarizes the 5 seeded
members and their roles in one line each, and restates the three-tier identity model — the same
three lines that appear in `api/routers/membership.py`'s own docstring and
`API_CONTRACT.md` §8, kept in sync across all three so a reader lands on the same mental model
regardless of which file they open first.

```python
def _get_first_member_pk(client):
    """Return the PK of the first member, or None if no data."""
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/members").json()
    return data[0]["sangha_sevi_pk"] if data else None


def _get_member_by_id(client, sangha_sevi_id):
    """Return the member dict matching the given sangha_sevi_id, or None."""
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/members").json()
    matches = [m for m in data if m["sangha_sevi_id"] == sangha_sevi_id]
    return matches[0] if matches else None
```

Two module-level helpers. `_get_first_member_pk` is the same `pytest.skip`-if-empty pattern used
by every other tier's "get any valid PK" helper. `_get_member_by_id` is new — Membership is the
first module where individual seeded rows have known, permanent business identifiers (`SS1`
through `SS5`) worth looking up by name rather than by position, since so many tests need to
assert something specific about *this particular member* (e.g. "SS3 was transferred," "SS4 is
Associate"). Nearly every test that depends on a specific seeded member calls this helper and
`pytest.skip(f"{id} not seeded")` if it returns `None` — the same availability-guard discipline
as `test_person.py`, applied to named rows instead of "any row."

#### `TestMemberList` (lines 62–213, 20 tests)

```python
def test_list_has_required_fields_if_data(self, client):
    """Each member has the expected response fields."""
    required = {
        "sangha_sevi_pk", "sangha_sevi_id",
        "person_pk", "person_id",
        "first_name", "middle_name", "last_name",
        "membership_type_master_data_pk",
        "membership_type_code", "membership_type_name",
        "membership_status_master_data_pk",
        "status_code", "status_name",
        "organization_pk", "organization_name", "organization_code",
        "local_sakha_erp_id",
        "joining_date", "renewal_due_date",
        "remarks", "is_active",
    }
    for m in client.get(f"{BASE}/members").json():
        assert required.issubset(m.keys()), (
            f"Missing fields in member {m.get('sangha_sevi_id', '?')}: "
            f"{required - m.keys()}"
        )
```

Proves `MemberResponse` carries both Tier 1 (`sangha_sevi_id`) and Tier 2 (`local_sakha_erp_id`)
identity fields plus resolved person/type/status/organization context — the same "one big
resolved row" shape `_MEMBER_SELECT` builds via five JOINs in the router. This exact required-set
is repeated verbatim in `TestMemberDetail.test_detail_has_required_fields`, since both endpoints
share `MemberResponse`.

```python
def test_seeded_member_ss1_is_regular(self, client):
    """SS1 (Ramesh) is a Regular member."""
    m = _get_member_by_id(client, "SS1")
    if m is None:
        pytest.skip("SS1 not seeded")
    assert m["membership_type_code"] == "REGULAR"
    assert m["status_code"] == "ACTIVE"
```

Three near-identical tests (`test_seeded_member_ss1_is_regular`, `_ss2_is_probationary`,
`_ss4_is_associate`) each pin one seeded member's `membership_type_code`, directly verifying the
seed file's own claims (`SS1`/`SS3` Regular, `SS2`/`SS5` Probationary, `SS4` Associate) actually
surface through the API — not just that the INSERT succeeded, but that the type/status JOINs
resolve to the right `master_data` row.

```python
def test_filter_by_type_code(self, client):
    """Filtering by type_code returns only matching members."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/members", params={"type_code": "REGULAR"})
    assert r.status_code == 200
    for m in r.json():
        assert m["membership_type_code"] == "REGULAR"
```

Three independent filters (`type_code`, `status_code`, `org_code`) each get their own
every-row-matches test, the same rigor as Organization's/Person's filter tests, plus
`test_filter_nonexistent_type_returns_empty` (fabricated code → `200 []`, not 404) and
`test_multiple_filters` (all three combined in one request, proving `AND`-composition). The
pagination group (6 tests: custom limit, `limit=0`→422, `limit=501`→422, `offset=-1`→422,
`offset=9999`→`200 []`, `limit=500`→200) is identical in shape to every other tier's pagination
suite — Membership reuses the same `DEFAULT_LIMIT`/`MAX_LIMIT` constants from `api/helpers.py`.

| Test | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `test_list_returns_200` | `GET /members` → 200, list |
| `test_list_all_active` | Every returned member has `is_active is True` |
| `test_list_excludes_audit_columns` | 6 audit columns absent from every row |
| `test_list_returns_seeded_members` | At least 5 seeded members exist |
| `test_members_have_local_sakha_erp_id` | At least 1 member has a non-null `local_sakha_erp_id` |

#### `TestMemberDetail` (lines 221–281, 5 tests)

Same 404/422/200/required-fields/audit-exclusion pattern as every other tier's detail endpoint
(`test_detail_fake_pk_returns_404`, `test_detail_bad_uuid_returns_422`,
`test_detail_valid_pk_returns_200`, `test_detail_has_required_fields`,
`test_detail_excludes_audit_columns`) — no Membership-specific behaviour here beyond reusing
`MemberResponse`'s field set from `TestMemberList`.

#### `TestMemberSearch` (lines 288–434, 16 tests)

```python
def test_search_by_erp_number(self, client):
    """Searching by ERP Number prefix finds the member."""
    members = client.get(f"{BASE}/members").json()
    erp_members = [m for m in members if m["local_sakha_erp_id"]]
    if not erp_members:
        pytest.skip("No members with ERP numbers seeded")
    erp_id = erp_members[0]["local_sakha_erp_id"]
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/search", params={"q": erp_id[:3]}).json()
    erp_ids = [m["local_sakha_erp_id"] for m in data]
    assert erp_id in erp_ids, (
        f"Expected {erp_id} in search results, got: {erp_ids}"
    )
```

This is the largest class in the file, and the only one to directly exercise all **three**
identity tiers as independent search paths: `test_search_by_sangha_sevi_id` (Tier 1 prefix),
`test_search_by_erp_number` (Tier 2 prefix, shown above — discovers a real seeded ERP number
first rather than hardcoding one, so the test survives seed-data changes), and
`test_search_by_kendra_number` (Tier 3 prefix, fetched via a nested call to the Parichaya Patra
sub-endpoint for SS1 before extracting the prefix before the first `/`) — plus
`test_search_by_person_id`, `test_search_by_name_trigram`, `test_search_by_mobile_number`, and
`test_search_by_email` covering the four non-tiered match paths. Together these seven tests are
the executable proof of `api/routers/membership.py::search_members`'s WHERE clause, field by
field.

```python
def test_search_by_email(self, client):
    """Searching by email prefix finds the member."""
    # P1 (SS1) has email 'ramesh.mishra@example.com'
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/search", params={"q": "ramesh.mishra"}).json()
    ids = [r["sangha_sevi_id"] for r in data]
    assert "SS1" in ids, f"Expected SS1 when searching by email prefix, got: {ids}"
```

Notably searches `"ramesh.mishra"` — a string containing a `.` — which exercises the router's
`re.split(r'[.@]', q)[0]` email-prefix handling (splits to `"ramesh"` for the trigram comparison
while still using the full string for the `ILIKE` email-prefix match) without asserting on the
split logic directly; the test only cares that the end-to-end result still finds `SS1`.

| Test | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `test_search_requires_q` | Omitting `q` → 422 |
| `test_search_q_too_short_returns_422` | `q="A"` (1 char) → 422 |
| `test_search_returns_200` | `q="SS"` → 200, list |
| `test_search_nonexistent_returns_empty` | `q="ZZZZNOTEXIST99"` → `200 []` |
| `test_search_max_50_results` | `len(results) <= 50` |
| `test_search_returns_member_response_fields` | Search results use full `MemberResponse` shape |
| `test_search_excludes_audit_columns` | Audit columns absent |
| `test_search_only_returns_active_members` | Every result has `is_active is True` |
| `test_search_has_security_headers` | `/search` carries the four core headers + `Cache-Control: no-store` |

#### `TestMemberAffiliations` (lines 442–513, 7 tests)

```python
def test_transferred_member_has_archived_and_active(self, client):
    """SS3 should have one ARCHIVED and one ACTIVE affiliation."""
    m = _get_member_by_id(client, "SS3")
    if m is None:
        pytest.skip("SS3 not seeded")
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/members/{m['sangha_sevi_pk']}/affiliations").json()
    statuses = {a["affiliation_status"] for a in data}
    assert "ARCHIVED" in statuses, "Expected ARCHIVED affiliation for transfer"
    assert "ACTIVE" in statuses, "Expected ACTIVE affiliation at new Sakha"
```

Beyond the standard 404/422/200/required-fields/audit-exclusion set, this class has two tests
specific to the seeded transfer scenario: `test_transferred_member_has_multiple_affiliations`
(SS3 has ≥2 affiliation rows) and the one above, which confirms the *specific* status split the
DDL's `chk_mem_sakha_aff_status_consistency` constraint guarantees — the old Sakha's row is
`ARCHIVED` (closed, `effective_to` set) and the new Sakha's row is `ACTIVE` (open-ended) — proving
`membership_sakha_affiliation`'s "current + history via row closure" design (see
`database/ddl/05_membership/README.md`) is both stored correctly and visible through the API.

#### `TestParichayaPatra` (lines 521–607, 8 tests)

```python
def test_probationary_has_no_parichaya_patra(self, client):
    """SS2 (Probationary) should have no Parichaya Patra."""
    m = _get_member_by_id(client, "SS2")
    if m is None:
        pytest.skip("SS2 not seeded")
    data = client.get(
        f"{BASE}/members/{m['sangha_sevi_pk']}/parichaya-patra"
    ).json()
    assert len(data) == 0, "Probationary member should not have PP"
```

`test_regular_member_has_parichaya_patra` (SS1, ≥1 record) and this test are a matched pair
proving the business rule "only Regular/Associate members receive a Parichaya Patra" is a fact
about the *seed data*, not something the API enforces — the endpoint itself has no type-based
filtering; it simply returns whatever `parichaya_patra` rows exist for the given
`sangha_sevi_pk`. `test_pp_document_number_is_kendra_number` only asserts `"/" in doc` — a loose
format check (Kendra numbers are `<seq>/<FY start>/<FY end>`), deliberately not over-specified
against the exact seeded value so the test survives future seed changes.

#### `TestAnumatiPatra` (lines 615–712, 9 tests)

```python
def test_regular_member_has_historical_expired_ap(self, client):
    """SS1 (Regular, was Probationary) has EXPIRED Anumati Patra."""
    m = _get_member_by_id(client, "SS1")
    if m is None:
        pytest.skip("SS1 not seeded")
    data = client.get(
        f"{BASE}/members/{m['sangha_sevi_pk']}/anumati-patra"
    ).json()
    expired = [ap for ap in data if ap["status"] == "EXPIRED"]
    assert len(expired) >= 1, (
        "Expected EXPIRED AP for SS1 (was probationary before Regular)"
    )
```

`test_regular_member_has_historical_expired_ap` and `test_ss3_has_historical_expired_ap` are
this class's most conceptually important tests: they prove Anumati Patra history survives
promotion to Regular — a member who has since been promoted still has their old, `EXPIRED`
credential retrievable, not deleted, consistent with the project's frozen "History Never
Deleted" principle. `test_probationary_has_anumati_patra` (SS2, ≥1 `ACTIVE` record) and
`test_ap_document_number_format` (`doc.startswith("AP/")`) round out the seed-specific
assertions; the remaining four tests (`_fake_pk_404`, `_bad_uuid_422`, `_valid_pk_200`,
`_has_required_fields`, `_excludes_audit_columns`) follow the standard sub-resource pattern.

#### `TestJourneyEvents` (lines 720–807, 9 tests)

```python
def test_kumari_transition_has_event(self, client):
    """SS5 (Smita, Kumari→Membership) has KUMARI_TRANSITION event."""
    m = _get_member_by_id(client, "SS5")
    if m is None:
        pytest.skip("SS5 not seeded")
    data = client.get(f"{BASE}/members/{m['sangha_sevi_pk']}/journey").json()
    event_types = {e["event_type"] for e in data}
    assert "KUMARI_TRANSITION" in event_types, (
        f"Expected KUMARI_TRANSITION event for SS5, got: {event_types}"
    )
```

`test_transferred_member_has_transfer_event` (SS3, `TRANSFER` in `event_types`) and this test
each pin one seeded member's lifecycle narrative to a specific `event_type` string —
`membership_journey_event.event_type` is a free-form `VARCHAR`, not an FK to `master_data` (see
`database/ddl/05_membership/README.md`), so these tests are the only guard that the *application
layer's* event-type vocabulary (`TRANSFER`, `KUMARI_TRANSITION`, `MEMBERSHIP_CREATED`,
`REGULAR_ENROLMENT`, `ASSOCIATE_ENROLMENT`, …) stays consistent between seed data and any future
consumer. `test_journey_events_ordered_by_date` asserts `dates == sorted(dates)` only when
`len(data) >= 2`, confirming the router's `ORDER BY mje.event_date ASC` without requiring a
specific event count.

#### `TestMembershipSecurity` (lines 815–848, 5 tests)

The same four-header-plus-cache-control contract verified per-module throughout the suite
(`test_membership_api_has_security_headers`, `test_membership_api_has_cache_control_no_store`,
`test_membership_ui_no_cache_control_no_store`, `test_404_has_security_headers`), plus one test
unique to Membership's deeper URL nesting:

```python
def test_sub_endpoints_have_security_headers(self, client):
    """Sub-resource 404s also get security headers."""
    r = client.get(f"{BASE}/members/{FAKE_UUID}/affiliations")
    assert r.status_code == 404
    assert r.headers["X-Content-Type-Options"] == "nosniff"
```

Membership is the first module with four distinct sub-resource routes hanging off a single
detail PK (`/affiliations`, `/parichaya-patra`, `/anumati-patra`, `/journey`); this test spot-checks
one of them to confirm `add_security_headers` wraps sub-resource 404s too, not just the top-level
`/members` and `/members/{pk}` routes.

#### `TestMembershipUI` (lines 856–967, 20 tests)

The standard UI-structure smoke-test suite (title, branding, Alpine.js/DaisyUI CDN references,
`membership.js` script tag, `x-data="membershipApp()"` binding, nav links, NSS logo, copyright
footer, tab bar) plus several Membership-specific assertions:

```python
def test_page_has_three_tier_legend(self, client):
    """Page contains the three-tier identity legend."""
    html = client.get("/membership").text
    assert "Sangha Sevi ID" in html
    assert "Sakha Sangha ID" in html


def test_page_has_darshaka_filter(self, client):
    """Page type filter includes Darshaka (not Probationary)."""
    html = client.get("/membership").text
    assert "Darshaka" in html


def test_anumati_patra_hidden_for_associate(self, client):
    """Anumati Patra section is conditionally hidden for Associate members."""
    html = client.get("/membership").text
    assert "membership_type_code !== 'ASSOCIATE'" in html
```

`test_page_has_three_tier_legend` and `test_page_has_sakha_sangha_id_label` both guard the
three-tier identity legend and the "Sakha Sangha ID" UI-label convention (see
`frontend/README.md`'s `membership.html` section) — the database column is `local_sakha_erp_id`,
but the UI never shows that name to a user. `test_page_has_darshaka_filter` guards the
`typeDisplayName()` UI convention that displays `PROBATIONARY` as "Darshaka" (MBR-007).
`test_anumati_patra_hidden_for_associate` is a literal substring match on the Alpine `x-show`
directive itself (`membership_type_code !== 'ASSOCIATE'`) — a white-box assertion that the
conditional-hide logic exists in the template at all, complementing
`TestAnumatiPatra.test_ap_has_required_fields`'s black-box proof that Associate members' API
responses are empty. `test_search_auto_selects_single_result` inspects
`assets/js/membership.js` directly (not the HTML) for the `searchResults.length === 1` /
`selectMember` auto-select pattern shared with `person.js`.

| Test | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `test_membership_page_returns_200` | `GET /membership` → 200, `text/html` |
| `test_page_contains_title` / `_branding` | "Membership" / "Nilachala Saraswata Sangha" in HTML |
| `test_page_loads_alpine_js` / `_daisyui` / `_membership_js` | CDN + script tag references |
| `test_page_has_alpine_data_binding` | `x-data="membershipApp()"` |
| `test_page_has_nav_links` | Links to `/`, `/family`, `/membership` |
| `test_page_has_tab_bar` | `switchTab('members')` / `switchTab('search')` |
| `test_page_has_search_tab_content` / `_search_detail_panel` | "Member Search" heading; ≥2 "Member Detail" headings (one per tab) |
| `test_page_has_person_id_column` | "Person ID" column present |
| `test_page_has_nss_logo` / `_copyright_footer` | Logo + "All rights reserved" |

### 2.9 `tests/test_data_integrity.py`

**Requirement**

Every per-module test file (`test_bootstrap.py`, `test_foundation.py`, `test_organization.py`,
`test_person.py`, `test_family.py`, `test_membership.py`) is written defensively — several tests
that walk sub-resources use `if not data: pytest.skip(...)` precisely so that an empty table
doesn't fail the whole suite. That defensiveness is correct for per-module isolation, but it
creates a blind spot: nothing forces a hard failure if a module's seed data silently regresses to
zero rows across a whole tier, because the tests that would have caught it are designed to
tolerate emptiness. `test_data_integrity.py` is a cross-module smoke-test file that closes this
gap — a second pass over every implemented tier (Bootstrap → Foundation → Organization → Person
→ Family → Membership) asserting the minimum "the seed actually landed" condition for each: at
least one active row, and, for relational data, at least one row whose related child record
(address, affiliation, journey event, credential) is also populated. No hardcoded IDs, codes, or
exact counts appear anywhere beyond the floor of `>= 1` (the sole exception,
`test_membership_types_diverse`, wants `>= 2` to prove type diversity survived seeding) — so this
file doesn't need editing again just because seed data grows; it only needs a new class when a
new module ships.

**Line-by-line**

```python
"""
NSS ERP — Cross-module data integrity smoke tests.

Verifies that every module has at least one active entity in the
database. These tests catch empty-table scenarios where per-module
tests would silently pass on zero records.

All assertions are dynamic — no hardcoded IDs, codes, or counts
beyond the minimum of 1.

Modules covered:
  - Tier 0: Bootstrap (roles, permissions)
  - Tier 1: Foundation (master_data via organization types/statuses)
  - Tier 2: Organization
  - Tier 3: Person
  - Tier 4: Family, Membership
"""

import pytest


pytestmark = pytest.mark.integration
```

The module docstring states the file's purpose (catch empty-table regressions that per-module
skip-on-empty tests would miss) and its one hard rule (no hardcoded IDs/codes/counts beyond
`>= 1`), then lists the six modules it covers by tier. `pytestmark = pytest.mark.integration`
applies the shared `integration` marker to every test in the file, same as every other test
module in `tests/`. The file is 281 lines and defines 6 classes totalling 23 test methods.

**`class TestBootstrapDataIntegrity:`** (2 tests)

```python
def test_at_least_one_active_role(self, client):
    """At least one active role exists in the system."""
    data = client.get("/api/v1/bootstrap/roles").json()
    assert len(data) >= 1, "No roles found — bootstrap seed missing"
    active = [r for r in data if r["is_active"] is True]
    assert len(active) >= 1, "No active roles found"


def test_permissions_endpoint_accessible(self, client):
    """Permissions endpoint responds (may be empty in Tier 0)."""
    r = client.get("/api/v1/bootstrap/permissions")
    assert r.status_code == 200
```

`test_at_least_one_active_role` calls `GET /api/v1/bootstrap/roles`, asserts at least one role
came back, then filters to `is_active is True` and asserts at least one of those too —
duplicating (deliberately, at a much lower bar) what `test_bootstrap.py`'s `TestRoles` already
pins more precisely. `test_permissions_endpoint_accessible` only asserts 200, matching the
by-design emptiness of `permissions` in Tier 0 (no permission catalogue frozen yet).

**`class TestFoundationDataIntegrity:`** (2 tests)

```python
def test_at_least_one_organization_type(self, client):
    """At least one active organization type exists."""
    data = client.get("/api/v1/organization/types").json()
    assert len(data) >= 1, "No organization types found — seed missing"
    active = [t for t in data if t["is_active"] is True]
    assert len(active) >= 1, "No active organization types found"


def test_at_least_one_organization_status(self, client):
    """At least one organization-scoped status exists."""
    data = client.get("/api/v1/organization/statuses").json()
    assert len(data) >= 1, "No organization statuses found — seed missing"
```

Despite the class name, both tests hit `/api/v1/organization/*` endpoints, not a
`/foundation/*` one — the docstring's own comment (`Tier 1: Foundation (master_data via
organization types/statuses)`) explains why: `organization_type`/`status` values live in
Foundation's `master_data` table (Foundation owns the master-data catalogue; Organization just
exposes two filtered views of it via its own router), so exercising them through the
Organization router is still, in substance, a Foundation seed-integrity check.

**`class TestOrganizationDataIntegrity:`** (4 tests)

```python
def test_at_least_one_root_organization(self, client):
    """At least one root organization (no parent) exists."""
    data = client.get("/api/v1/organization/organizations").json()
    roots = [o for o in data if o["parent_organization_pk"] is None]
    assert len(roots) >= 1, "No root organizations found"


def test_hierarchy_has_nodes(self, client):
    """Organization hierarchy has at least one node."""
    data = client.get("/api/v1/organization/hierarchy").json()
    assert len(data) >= 1, "Hierarchy is empty — seed missing"
```

Alongside `test_at_least_one_active_organization` (same active-filter pattern as the Bootstrap
class), `test_at_least_one_root_organization` filters on `parent_organization_pk is None` to
confirm the hierarchy has a top (Kendra), and `test_hierarchy_has_nodes` hits the recursive-CTE
`/hierarchy` endpoint directly rather than inferring tree shape from the flat `/organizations`
list. `test_at_least_one_org_with_contact_info` filters for any organization with a truthy
`phone_number`, `mobile_number`, or `email` — guarding against a seed regression where
organizations exist but were inserted with all contact fields left null.

**`class TestPersonDataIntegrity:`** (3 tests)

```python
def test_at_least_one_person_with_address(self, client):
    """At least one person has an address record."""
    data = client.get("/api/v1/person/persons").json()
    if not data:
        pytest.skip("No persons seeded")
    for person in data:
        addrs = client.get(
            f"/api/v1/person/persons/{person['person_pk']}/addresses"
        ).json()
        if addrs:
            return  # pass
    pytest.skip("No persons with addresses seeded")
```

`test_at_least_one_active_person` and `test_at_least_one_person_with_gender` follow the same
active-filter / non-null-field pattern as earlier classes. `test_at_least_one_person_with_address`
is the first test in the file to loop over every returned entity checking a sub-resource, and it
`pytest.skip`s (not fails) on either "no persons" or "no person has an address" — this is the one
class where the file's own stated design goal (catch empty-table scenarios other tests would
silently pass through) is itself relaxed to a skip rather than a hard failure, presumably because
address data is optional per-person rather than a hard seed-completeness guarantee.

**`class TestFamilyDataIntegrity:`** (4 tests)

```python
def test_at_least_one_family_has_members(self, client):
    """At least one family has current members."""
    data = client.get("/api/v1/family/families").json()
    if not data:
        pytest.skip("No families seeded")
    for family in data:
        members = client.get(
            f"/api/v1/family/families/{family['family_group_pk']}/members"
        ).json()
        if members:
            return  # pass
    pytest.fail("No families have any current members")
```

Unlike `TestPersonDataIntegrity`'s address check, the three sub-resource loops here
(`test_at_least_one_family_has_members`, `_has_head`, `_has_head_history`) all end in
`pytest.fail(...)` rather than `pytest.skip(...)` if no family in the whole result set has the
sub-resource populated — only the top-level "no families at all" case skips; once families exist,
having zero of them with any current member, head, or head-history record is treated as a hard
failure. `test_at_least_one_family_has_head` additionally filters the members list on
`is_head is True` before checking for a match, and `test_at_least_one_active_family` opens the
class with the same active-filter pattern used throughout the file.

**`class TestMembershipDataIntegrity:`** (8 tests)

```python
def test_at_least_one_regular_member(self, client):
    """At least one REGULAR member type exists."""
    data = client.get("/api/v1/membership/members").json()
    regular = [m for m in data if m["membership_type_code"] == "REGULAR"]
    assert len(regular) >= 1, "No REGULAR members found"


def test_membership_types_diverse(self, client):
    """At least 2 distinct membership types exist across all members."""
    data = client.get("/api/v1/membership/members").json()
    types = {m["membership_type_code"] for m in data}
    assert len(types) >= 2, (
        f"Expected at least 2 membership types, got: {types}"
    )
```

The largest class in the file, mirroring Membership's own status as the module with the most
sub-resources. Four tests follow the same "loop every member, `pytest.fail` if none has the
sub-resource" pattern as `TestFamilyDataIntegrity`, one per credential/history type:
`test_at_least_one_member_with_affiliation` (`/affiliations`),
`test_at_least_one_member_with_journey_events` (`/journey`),
`test_at_least_one_member_with_parichaya_patra` (`/parichaya-patra`), and
`test_at_least_one_member_with_anumati_patra` (`/anumati-patra`) — the last of which is notable
because Associate members deliberately have *no* Anumati Patra (see `TestAnumatiPatra` in
§2.8), so this test is only satisfied by whichever non-Associate member the seed happens to
include, not by every member. `test_at_least_one_regular_member` and
`test_at_least_one_member_with_erp_number` (checks for a truthy `local_sakha_erp_id`) follow the
plain filter-and-count pattern. `test_membership_types_diverse` is the file's only `>= 2`
assertion — it collects the distinct `membership_type_code` values across every member and
requires at least 2, guarding against a seed regression where every member accidentally got
inserted with the same membership type.
